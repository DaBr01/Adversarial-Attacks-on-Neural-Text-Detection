The experience that taught me how looks could be deceiving.
A week without internet and technology.
The impact your first love had on your life.
How much did your teachers contribute to making you the person you are today?
An experience that made you realize your parents were or weren't always right.
A moment when someone you didn't like surprised you with kindness.
The influence technology has had on your hobbies and life.
An achievement outside of academic life?
Which school lesson had the biggest influence on your life?
A day when you fought procrastination.
The time you faced rejection.
The time when you stood against your parents.
An experience that left you helpless.
The time you prayed to be an only child.
An act of kindness you can never forget.
Death of a loved one.
Your biggest pet peeve.
Your definition of a perfect weekend.
The things you regret most in life.
Your first experience of an air trip.
