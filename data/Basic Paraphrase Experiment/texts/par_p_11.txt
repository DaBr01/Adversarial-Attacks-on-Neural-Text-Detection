The decision of the uk to leave the european union known as brexit was a historic event that shook not only the uk but the entire european union. The june 2016 referendum resulted in a narrow victory for the leave campaign with 52 of the voters opting to leave. The decision was based on several factors including immigration sovereignty economic arguments and a desire for greater control over the uk's laws and regulations. One of the reasons for leaving the uk was immigration. The free movement of people within the eu led to higher levels of immigration mainly from eastern european countries. This influx of migrants was seen by many as putting pressure on the public services bringing down wages and increasing competition for jobs. Leave would allow britain to regain control over its borders and implement its own immigration policy in line with the country's needs and priorities the leave campaign says. Sovereignty was another important topic in the brexit debate. Many uk-based supporters of brexit felt that the country had lost too much of its sovereignty to the eu as the bloc's rules and regulations often affected the country's capacity to govern itself. It was seen as a way to reclaim the lost sovereignty and to ensure that decisions regarding the uk were taken by the uk government rather than by eu institutions based in brussels. Economics plays also a significant role in the brexit debate. The leave campaign claimed britain would be better off economically outside the eu if it could negotiate its own trade deals set its own regulations and avoid contributing to the eu budget. The campaign also argued that leaving the eu would allow the uk to regain control of its laws and regulations making it more competitive and flexible in the global market. There was also a desire among many people who supported brexit to have more control over uk laws and regulations. The system of governance of the eu which involved a complex web of institutions and decision-making processes was often seen as undemocratic and opaque. It was seen as a way of ensuring that the uk could make its own laws and regulations in line with the preferences of its citizens and elected representatives. The decision of the uk to leave the eu was the result of a complex interplay of factors including concerns about sovereignty in the economy and control of laws and. While the brexit process was challenging and divisive it also raised important questions about the nature of european integration and the future of the eu. Only time will tell what will be the long-term consequences of a brexit for the uk and the eu as a whole.
