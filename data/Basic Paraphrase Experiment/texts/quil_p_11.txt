Brexit, or the UK's choice to leave the European Union, was a momentous development that rocked the EU as a whole in addition to the UK. With 52% of voters choosing to leave the EU, the Leave campaign narrowly prevailed in the June 2016 referendum. This choice was influenced by a number of considerations, including debates about economics, sovereignty, immigration, and a desire for more control over UK laws and regulations.

The problem of immigration was a major factor in the UK's decision to exit the EU. Immigration has surged as a result of the EU's free movement of people, especially from Eastern European nations. Many people believed that this immigration wave would strain public services, lower salaries, and intensify competition for employment. The argument put up by the Leave campaign was that the UK would be able to retake control of its borders and establish its own immigration laws, which would be more in line with the interests and requirements of the nation.


Another crucial topic in the Brexit discussion was sovereignty. Many proponents of Brexit believed that the UK had given up too much sovereignty to the EU because they believed that the bloc's laws and regulations interfered with the nation's right to self-governance. Regaining this lost sovereignty and ensuring that decisions pertaining to the UK were taken by the UK government instead of EU institutions headquartered in Brussels were the two main goals of leaving the EU.

The Brexit discussion was largely influenced by economic reasons. The Brexit campaign said that since the UK could negotiate its own trade agreements, impose its own laws, and avoid paying into the EU budget, it would be economically better off outside the EU. The campaign also argued that the UK would become more flexible and competitive in the international market if it were to recover control over its rules and regulations after its exit from the EU.

Lastly, a lot of people who supported Brexit wanted more authority over UK laws and regulations. The intricate network of organisations and decision-making procedures that comprised the EU's governance structure was often seen as being opaque and undemocratic. It was believed that the UK could enact rules and regulations that reflected the will of its elected representatives and population by leaving the EU.

In summary, the UK's choice to exit the EU was the consequence of a complicated web of interrelated considerations, such as worries about immigration, economy, sovereignty, and the ability to enact laws and regulations. In addition to being difficult and polarising, the Brexit process has brought up significant issues about the character of European integration and the EU's future. What the long-term effects of Brexit will be for both the UK and the EU as a whole are yet unknown.
