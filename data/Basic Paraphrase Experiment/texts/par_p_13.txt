In today's technology-driven world gadgets have become a necessary part of everyday life for people of all ages including children. The prevalence of smartphones, tablets, laptops, and other electronic devices has made it easier for kids to access information and communicate with others. However the use of electronic devices among children raises concerns about the possible impact on their studies. One of the ways that giving kids different gadgets can affect their studies is through distractions. With the constant notifications updates and entertainment options available on smartphones and tablets children may find it difficult to concentrate on their schoolwork. The temptation to check social media play games or watch videos can lead to a reduction in productivity and concentration. This can result in poor academic performance and a lack of motivation to study. Furthermore the excessive use of technology can have negative effects on the health of children. Doing excessive hours staring at screens can cause headaches and disrupt sleep patterns. Research has shown that blue light emitted by screens can interfere with the production of melatonin a hormone that regulates sleep. Poor sleep quality can affect children's cognitive function, memory retention, and overall academic performance. In addition the use of gadgets can also impact on the social skills and relationships of children. Too much electronic time can hamper face-to-face interactions with family members and peers. This can affect children's ability to develop empathy and emotional intelligence. Studies have shown that excessive screen time can lead to anxiety and depression among children. On the other hand, gadgets can also have positive effects on children's studies. Access to educational apps, online resources, and digital textbooks can enhance learning opportunities and make studying more engaging and interactive. For example students can use educational games to reinforce concepts learned in class or collaborate with classmates using digital tools to make projects. Gadgets can also help children with special needs by providing personalized learning materials and accessibility features. The suggestion of introducing the kids to different gadgets can have both positive and negative effects on their studies. While the latest technology can provide educational benefits and enhance learning experiences they can also lead to distraction health problems and social challenges. It is important for parents and educators to establish healthy screen time limits promote balance between online and offline activities and monitor children's gadget use to ensure that it does not interfere with their academic success. By encouraging responsible use of gadgets and incorporating them into a well-rounded educational experience children can leverage the benefits of technology while minimising its potential drawbacks.
