Everyone has wondered how the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) will affect the education system around the world. The COVID-19 pandemic began spreading in early 2020 and led to the closure of schools and universities around the world. This significant impact has left profound and obvious impacts on the education system in many countries. First and foremost, the COVID-19 pandemic led to the closure of schools and universities for long periods, forcing students to move to a distance education system. These shifts have caused significant challenges for students and teachers alike. It should be noted that these transformations required advanced technology and good Internet connectivity, which made the situation difficult for some students and teachers, especially in remote areas or those that lack the necessary equipment. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a positive impact on some aspects of education. The pandemic has encouraged the adoption of some new educational technologies, such as e-learning and hybrid education, which has improved some aspects of education and made them more advanced and interactive. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed many gaps in the education system, leading to an urgent need to make radical and sustainable changes. It is necessary to work to strengthen the technological infrastructure of schools and universities, train teachers to use educational technology effectively, and provide psychological and social support to students.
