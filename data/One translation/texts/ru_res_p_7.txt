Over the past decade, significant changes have occurred in the field of family relations and the number of divorces has increased significantly. This article will examine the main reasons for the change in the divorce rate over the past ten years.

In modern society, an increasing number of people view marriage as a “union of equals,” where each partner has the right to self-realization and personal happiness. Because of this, conflicts and disagreements arise that lead to divorce. Another reason for the increase in divorce is economic instability. During the crisis, many families experience financial difficulties, which leads to increased levels of stress and tension in family relationships. It can also lead to the destruction of a marriage. Also, increasing the level of education and professional self-realization among women has an impact on the divorce rate. Today, more and more women are becoming independent and self-reliant, which makes them less dependent on their husbands. This allows them to make their own decisions and, in case of dissatisfaction in the marriage, it is easier to decide on divorce. Also, one of the factors influencing the divorce rate is changes in sociocultural stereotypes and ideas about family life. In modern society, fewer and fewer people believe that marriage should be “for life,” and the idea that divorce is normal if the relationship is not satisfactory for one or both spouses is becoming increasingly common.
