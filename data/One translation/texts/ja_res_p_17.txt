The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the education system. This pandemic has brought about major changes in schools around the world, revolutionizing teaching methods and learning environments. In the first stage of the pandemic, many countries temporarily closed schools and distance education was rapidly introduced. Online classes and distance learning platforms spread rapidly, requiring students and teachers to use new technologies to receive education. In addition, traditional teaching formats changed, with face-to-face classes in schools being restricted and hybrid education systems being introduced to prevent the spread of coronavirus. This expansion of distance education required students and teachers to acquire new teaching methods and learning skills. Teachers adapted to online education and sought ways to communicate effectively with students. Meanwhile, students worked to improve their self-learning abilities and how to use online tools. In addition, the coronavirus restrictions prevented many students from accessing learning, so the spread of digital access became an urgent need. The impact of this pandemic has highlighted educational disparities. A large gap has emerged between students with a good remote learning environment and those with limited digital access. While the digital divide has accelerated educational inequality, many schools and governments have taken various initiatives to address this issue. Given this situation, it is necessary for the education system to adopt a more flexible approach going forward. Various reforms are needed, including investment in digital education, expansion of online classes, and improvement of learning environments.
