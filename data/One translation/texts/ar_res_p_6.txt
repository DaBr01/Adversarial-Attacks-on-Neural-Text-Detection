The impact of university debt on the lives of students in the future One of the biggest challenges that university students face in the current era is the weight of debt accumulated as a result of high education costs. This problem raises questions about its impact on studentsâ€™ lives in the future, and to what extent the burden of university debt can affect their social and economic future. College debt is a huge burden on students, as they find themselves having to bear heavy financial burdens after graduation. If students are unable to pay these debts on time, they face serious consequences that negatively affect their future lives.
