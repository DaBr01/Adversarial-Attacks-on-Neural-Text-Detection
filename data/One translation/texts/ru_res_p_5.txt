Universities nowadays are becoming more and more commercially oriented. This is an inevitable process caused by changes in society, economy and education. Many universities are facing financial difficulties and are forced to look for new sources of income. As a result, many universities are beginning to view themselves as businesses seeking to profit and create a competitive advantage. One of the main reasons why universities are becoming more business-oriented is the lack of government funding. In many countries, educational institutions are experiencing a shortage of funds due to cuts in education budgets. In this situation, universities need to independently look for ways to raise funds and ensure their financial sustainability. In addition, modern universities are faced with increasing competition in the educational services market. This leads to the need to develop and implement more effective management and marketing methods. Many universities are starting to actively promote their degree programs in an effort to attract more students and increase their profitability. An important aspect of making universities business-oriented is the development of partnerships with enterprises and companies. Many universities partner with businesses to create joint training programs, conduct research and develop innovative projects. Such partnerships allow universities to obtain additional resources and provide their students with greater access to real-world practice and experience. However, becoming business-oriented universities can also have negative consequences. For example, this could lead to a loss of autonomy and independence for educational institutions if they become too financially dependent.
