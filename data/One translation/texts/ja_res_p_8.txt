The debate continues in the education community about whether schools should allow students to use smartphones. Some people argue that smartphones can be a distraction from lessons and impair students&#39; concentration. However, I believe that smartphones can bring many benefits to education. First, using smartphones allows students to easily obtain information. With access to a variety of information and data through the Internet, they can learn about various topics from around the world. For example, they can provide information that helps teachers find suitable cases. Second, using smartphones can improve communication skills. Using social media and messaging apps can facilitate smooth communication between students and teachers. In addition, there are more opportunities for online classes and group work, so collaboration skills are expected to improve. In addition, smartphones can provide innovative ways in education. Using apps can make learning fun for students and make lessons more effective. Also, using digital teaching materials allows students to learn at their own pace. Conversely, there are some concerns about using smartphones in school. Students may use smartphones during class to focus on other things, or communication with teachers and other students may be weakened. Smartphone use also poses the risk of bullying and exposure to inappropriate content, so it needs to be managed. However, to address these concerns, it is important to teach students how to use smartphones appropriately through education rather than restricting their use.
