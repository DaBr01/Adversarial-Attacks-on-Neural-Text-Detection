Immigration policies are one of the factors that lead countries to take different approaches based on different values, cultures, and economic conditions. In this essay, we will compare the immigration policies of Australia and Japan. Australia is a country based on multiculturalism and has a relatively open attitude toward immigration. The Australian government accepts new immigrants into the country through economic and humanitarian immigration programs. The economic immigration program aims to actively accept immigrants with skills and experience, and they are expected to contribute to the development of the workforce and economy. On the other hand, the humanitarian immigration program aims to provide protection to people fleeing persecution or dangerous situations. On the other hand, Japan has a relatively closed immigration policy. The Japanese government limits the acceptance of foreign workers and focuses on protecting the employment of Japanese workers. Japan imposes strict conditions on foreign workers, making it difficult for them to obtain permanent residency or citizenship. This is thought to be because Japan protects its unique culture and traditions and limits the impact of foreign culture and values on society. What can be seen from the comparison of immigration policies between Australia and Japan is that both countries form immigration policies based on different values, cultures, and economic conditions. Australia respects multiculturalism and contributes to economic and social development by accepting immigrants, while Japan restricts the acceptance of foreign workers while preserving its own culture and traditions. It can be seen that the immigration policies of the two countries take different approaches to respond to the characteristics and challenges of each country. In summary, immigration policies are formed based on the different cultures, values, and economic conditions of each country, and the differences between Australia and Japan are clear.
