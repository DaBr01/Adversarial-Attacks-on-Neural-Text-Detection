Due to stress, loneliness, social pressure, etc., the number of young people suffering from depression is increasing. In order to improve this situation, effective efforts are needed. In this paper, we will discuss effective ways to reduce depression in young people. First, it is important to develop exercise and healthy lifestyle habits. Exercise improves physical strength and relieves stress and anxiety. In addition, by eating healthy foods and getting enough sleep, you can maintain a balance between body and mind. Young people are particularly prone to disruption of their daily rhythms, so it is important to develop healthy lifestyle habits. Second, improving communication skills is effective. Young people are prone to feelings of loneliness and isolation, so stress can be reduced through communication with others. It is important to communicate in various ways, such as interacting with friends and family, and interacting through hobbies. In addition, receiving psychological counseling and psychological education is also effective. Depression in young people may be influenced by internal problems or past trauma. Through psychological counseling, you can deepen your self-understanding and receive help in solving problems. In addition, by receiving psychological education, you can learn how to deal with stress and anxiety. In addition, efforts to encourage social participation and self-realization are also effective. By demonstrating their abilities and interests and interacting with society, young people can feel a sense of self-affirmation and a sense of purpose in life. It is important to provide opportunities to encourage self-actualization, such as volunteering or participating in sports teams.
