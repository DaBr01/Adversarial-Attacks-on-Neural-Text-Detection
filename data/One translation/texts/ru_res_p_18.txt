Global warming is one of the most serious problems facing humanity at present. It leads to climate change, accelerated melting of ice and rising sea levels, which can have catastrophic consequences for life on the planet. There are many factors leading to global warming, but one of the main ones is the actions of individuals. This study examines some of them. The first of these actions is the use of fossil fuels. The combustion of oil, coal and gas to produce energy is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide and methane. According to the World Meteorological Organization, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere reached historical highs in 2020. Therefore, every person who uses fossil fuels for their needs contributes to global warming. The second action that contributes to global warming is automobile traffic. Emissions from motor vehicles account for a significant portion of total greenhouse gas emissions. According to the International Energy Agency, transportation is the second largest source of carbon dioxide emissions after electricity generation. Therefore, switching to cleaner modes of transport, such as electric cars, can significantly reduce the negative impact on the environment. The third factor contributing to global warming is meat consumption. Meat production, especially from cattle, is a major source of methane emissions, one of the most dangerous greenhouse gases. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, meat and dairy production
