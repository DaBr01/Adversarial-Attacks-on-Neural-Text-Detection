Impact of Covid-19 on the world&#39;s educational system Due to the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the global education system faced serious challenges and changes. Schools and universities have been forced to switch to distance learning, which has led to significant changes in the learning process and public perception of education. The pandemic has forced educational institutions around the world to rethink their teaching methods and adapt to new conditions. One of the major changes brought about by Covid-19 has been the move to distance learning. Schools and universities in many countries were closed, and students were forced to study at home. This has led to educators being forced to develop new teaching methods and use online platforms to conduct lessons. Some pupils and students faced difficulties in adapting to new conditions and methods of learning, such as a lack of personal contact with teachers and peers. The impact of Covid-19 on the education system has also increased inequalities in access to education.

This has created serious problems for educational inequality and highlighted the need to improve access to education for all. Additionally, Covid-19 has also impacted the health and well-being of students. The pandemic has resulted in stress and anxiety for students who have had to adapt to new learning environments and social isolation. Some pupils and students have faced psychological problems due to the long period of distance learning and restrictions on social interaction.
