The relationship between the United States of America and North Korea is one of the most tense and tense international relations in the world. This relationship dates back to the Cold War, when the Korean Peninsula was divided between North Korea, backed by the Soviet Union, and South Korea, backed by the United States, which led to the Korean War in 1950. Since then, the relationship between the two countries has continued to accumulate tension and ongoing conflicts. Despite several attempts to improve relations between the two countries, such as the Geneva Framework Agreement in 1994 and the Singapore Agenda Agreement in 2018, escalations and transgressions continue to occur between the two countries. The main issues between the United States and North Korea center around issues such as North Korea&#39;s nuclear program and missile tests, human rights violations, and repeated threats to use nuclear weapons against the American country. These issues have been used as a means of intimidation and bargaining by North Korea, while the United States uses political and economic pressure to influence North Korea&#39;s behavior. On the other hand, North Korea sees the United States as its main enemy, and indoctrinates its people that the American country seeks to destroy it and interfere in its internal affairs. This increases the gap between the two countries and complicates the process of negotiating and reaching common solutions. The relationship worsened
