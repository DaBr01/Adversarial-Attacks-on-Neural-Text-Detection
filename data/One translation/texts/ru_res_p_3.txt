Technology and gadgets play a significant role in the daily lives of children nowadays. Smartphones, tablets, computers and other devices have become an integral part of their education, entertainment and communication. However, they also have an impact on the learning process and academic performance of children. This article examines how technology and gadgets affect children&#39;s learning and how they can be used effectively in education. Firstly, technology and gadgets can be a powerful tool for children&#39;s learning and development. Through interactive apps, online courses and educational games, children can explore subjects in depth and develop skills that will help them in the future. For example, using special apps for learning math or foreign languages can make learning more fun and effective. However, on the other hand, too much use of technology and gadgets can distract children from their studies and impair their academic performance. Constantly being on social media, playing games and watching videos can take away time from children that could be spent studying and doing homework. In addition, excessive use of gadgets can negatively affect children&#39;s health, affecting their vision, sleep and psychological state. To effectively use technology and gadgets in education, it is important to be able to properly supervise their use by children. Parents and teachers can create specific rules for gadget use, limit time spent on them, and monitor what apps and sites their children visit. It is also important to teach children to consciously use technology and teach them to adequately evaluate information received from the Internet. In conclusion, technology and gadgets have both positive and negative effects on children&#39;s learning process.
