The debate about whether universities should provide accommodations for students with disabilities is a hot topic in education today. On the one hand, supporters of this initiative believe that all students should have equal access to education, regardless of their physical or psychological condition. On the other hand, opponents believe that this will create unacceptable pressure on university resources. First of all, it is important to consider that universities are required to comply with disability rights legislation. In many countries, laws require educational institutions to provide adequate accommodations for students with disabilities. This includes various types of adaptation, ranging from available premises and technical facilities to the support of specialized specialists. Moreover, providing accommodations for students with disabilities is not only a matter of social justice, but also a practical necessity. After all, the lack of appropriate conditions can interfere with the full learning and development of these students. For example, students with limited mobility may require special equipment or personal assistants to move around the university campus. However, it is also worth considering the economic side of the issue. Providing adapted conditions for students with disabilities requires significant financial costs. Universities may face tight budgets and may not always be able to afford these costs. In addition, in many cases it is necessary to reconstruct educational buildings and purchase specialized educational materials. However, there are many practical solutions that can help universities support students with disabilities.
