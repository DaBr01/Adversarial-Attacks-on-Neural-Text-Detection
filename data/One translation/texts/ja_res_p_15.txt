There were many events that led to World War I. Behind these events were a combination of political, economic, and military factors that led to a major war that involved the whole of Europe. Here, I would like to explore the main events that led to World War I. First, the expansion of imperialism is said to be an event that led to World War I. From the late 19th century, European powers competed to acquire new colonies in Africa and Asia. This expansion of imperialism created conflict between nations, which led to the outbreak of World War I. Next, it is said that the race to expand arms was the cause of World War I. From the end of the 19th century, each country had been increasing its military and preparing for war. In particular, the race to expand naval power between Germany and Britain increased tensions and paved the way for World War I. In addition, the alliance systems and foreign policies of each country also influenced the outbreak of World War I. At that time in Europe, major powers such as Germany, Austria, Britain, and France were each allied with each other, and a fine tug of war was being waged. These alliances ultimately paved the way to war. The Sarajevo incident on June 28, 1914 was the trigger for World War I. The assassination of the Austrian Archduke and his wife in Sarajevo triggered conflict between Austria and Serbia, leading to other countries joining the war one after another. These events were important factors leading to the outbreak of World War I. The war was the result of a combination of various factors, including the expansion of imperialism, military expansion, alliances, and the Sarajevo incident.
