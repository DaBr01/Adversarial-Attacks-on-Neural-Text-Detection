Do children who attend kindergarten have better results in school? This issue has long been controversial among education experts. Some studies show that children who go to daycare do better in school, while other studies find little difference between children who attend daycare and those who stay at home. According to daycare advocates, the benefits of attending such facilities include developing social skills, improving cognitive abilities and preparing for school. Proponents of this point of view argue that children who spend time in kindergarten are more prepared for the learning process at school, as they learn to interact with other children, develop their communication skills and learn independence. These skills, they believe, help children achieve academic success and adapt to new environments. However, opponents of kindergarten argue that children can develop and achieve academic success while staying at home with their parents or loved ones. They point out that kindergarten is not always the best option for all children due to its limited opportunities for individual development. Opponents also worry about daycare&#39;s impact on creating stress and depression in children due to prolonged separation from parents. In order to more clearly understand how attending kindergarten affects children&#39;s success in school, it is necessary to turn to the results of scientific research. One such study, conducted by Northwestern University, found that children who attended kindergarten had higher math and reading scores in elementary school than their peers who stayed at home. E
