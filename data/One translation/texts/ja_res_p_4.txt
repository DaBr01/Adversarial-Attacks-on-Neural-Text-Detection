There are various research results on whether children&#39;s academic performance improves when they attend kindergarten. I would like to consider how attending kindergarten affects success at school and its advantages and disadvantages. First, let&#39;s consider how attending kindergarten affects academic performance. Kindergarten provides children with the opportunity to acquire basic learning and social life skills. For example, they learn to recognize numbers and letters, understand colors and shapes, and communicate with friends. These basic skills are an important foundation for learning at school. Therefore, attending kindergarten may lead to improved school performance. However, attending kindergarten does not necessarily lead to improved academic performance. Children who do not attend kindergarten can also have various learning opportunities at home and in the community. Therefore, their academic performance is not necessarily better than that of children who attended kindergarten. In addition, if attending kindergarten is not appropriate, it may cause children to feel stressed and lose motivation to learn. In addition, the extent to which attending kindergarten affects academic performance will vary depending on each child&#39;s environment and personality. For example, if the home environment is sufficiently supportive, or if the child is curious and has high self-esteem, they may achieve good academic results without attending kindergarten. Therefore, it cannot be said that attending kindergarten is essential for improving academic performance. In summary, although attending kindergarten may have a positive effect on improving academic performance, it is not necessarily the case that it is necessary to attend kindergarten.
