Events and experiences that I agree are causing an increase in terrorism It is said that terrorism is increasing all over the world, and that the cause is due to various factors. Events and experiences that I think I agree with include poverty, religious extremism, political instability, and social inequality. First, poverty is thought to be influencing the increase in terrorism. People who are economically struggling may have no hope and a low social status. Under such circumstances, it can be said that the right conditions are in place for extremist organizations and terrorists to recruit new members. As economic disparity widens, the likelihood of terrorist attacks will also increase. Second, religious extremism is thought to be influencing the increase in terrorism. People with extreme religious views do not tolerate other beliefs and values and may use violent means. In particular, Islamic fundamentalism can lead to the use of force by some extremist groups. It can be said that such extreme beliefs are promoting the spread of terrorism. Furthermore, political instability is thought to be involved in the increase in terrorism. As conflict, discord, and corruption in governments and organizations spread, extremists may take advantage of the chaos to carry out terrorist attacks. It is said that political chaos is a breeding ground for terrorism, especially in the Middle East. As long as political unrest continues, the threat of terrorism will continue to rise. It is also believed that social inequality is related to the increase in terrorist attacks. When the upper classes or privileged classes in society commit injustice or discrimination, their dissatisfaction and anger may encourage them to turn to terrorism. As social injustice spreads, terrorist attackers may also become more likely to take part.
