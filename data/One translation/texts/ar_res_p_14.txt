Immigration policies are among the most important issues facing countries today, as they greatly affect the economy, culture and society. In this research, we will compare immigration policies in general in the United States of America and Canada. The United States of America and Canada are considered leading countries in receiving immigrants, but the immigration policies in both countries differ greatly. In the United States, policies have tended to be more stringent and specific in recent years, with crackdowns on illegal immigrants and caps on the number of immigrants accepted annually. In addition, the US government enforces forced return policies and strict border controls between the United States and neighboring countries. On the other hand, Canada adopts more open and tolerant immigration policies, as it seeks to receive immigrants and provide them with job opportunities. Canada is a favorite destination for immigrants looking for a better life and new job opportunities. The Canadian government provides work and residency visa programs for immigrants and seeks to attract skilled and talented workers from around the world. Moreover, Canada seeks to better integrate immigrants into society by offering educational programs and training courses to learn English and French, in addition to providing support and assistance.
