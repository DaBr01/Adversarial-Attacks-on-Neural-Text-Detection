It is believed that students learn better in a single-sex school than in a mixed one. This statement has both its supporters and opponents. The inclination towards this idea arises from the assumption that boys and girls have different learning methods and different learning needs. Those who support this point of view argue that in a single-sex school, children feel more comfortable, which contributes to better learning of educational material. Boys and girls, being in the same class group, can develop in accordance with their individual needs and abilities. It is also believed that in a single-sex environment, students can communicate more easily with each other and participate more actively in lessons. Some studies show that girls do better in math in single-sex schools, while boys do better in humanities subjects. This is because in mixed-gender environments, students have fewer opportunities to express their academic potential. However, opponents of this idea argue that there are many examples of successful education in mixed schools. The main argument of this group is that life in the real world is not limited to single-sex environments, and children should study in mixed groups to learn how to communicate and cooperate with all people in the future. In addition, some studies show that children studying in mixed schools have better adaptation and socialization skills, which is also important for their future. In this case, mixed schools can provide a wider range of development and learning opportunities. Thus, the question of where students learn better - in a single-sex or mixed school - remains debatable. Every
