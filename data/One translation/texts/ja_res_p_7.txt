Reasons for changes in divorce rates over the past decade In recent years, divorce rates have been rising worldwide, and the change has been remarkable even in the past decade. Why did this change occur? In this paper, we analyze the factors that influenced the change in divorce rates over the past decade and explain the background and reasons. First, economic factors have had a major impact on the change in divorce rates. The economy has been unstable over the past decade, with high unemployment and poverty rates. This has led to an increase in economic problems between couples, and the stress caused by this is a factor that causes divorce. In particular, as more women have entered the workforce and become financially independent, the economic dependency has weakened, and the number of cases in which people decide to divorce has increased. Changes in social values are also affecting changes in divorce rates. Over the past decade, attitudes toward family and marriage have changed, with a growing tendency to place importance on personal happiness and self-realization. As a result, the idea that there is no need to continue an unhappy marriage has spread, and it can be said that more people are choosing to divorce. In addition, the spread of SNS and the Internet has expanded the range of encounters with the opposite sex, and values regarding marriage have changed, which is also thought to be affecting the change in divorce rates. Furthermore, lack of communication between couples and differences in values also affect the change in divorce rate. In the past 10 years, the difficulty of balancing work and family life has led to an increase in cases of lack of communication between couples and a deepening rift between them. Differences in values and inconsistencies in ways of thinking are also factors that cause divorce. In particular, disagreements over child-rearing and education are often linked to divorce.
