Events and experiences that I agree with are causing an increase in terrorism. Terrorism is an act of violence and intimidation that violates public order and the safety of people. The increase in terrorist attacks around the world is a matter of concern and calls for a search for the reasons behind such destructive behavior. Although terrorism is caused by many factors, certain events and experiences reflect the issues that reinforce and fuel the phenomenon. One of the reasons for the increase in terrorism is political instability in some regions. Countries experiencing political conflict or revolution often experience increased levels of terrorist activity. The breakdown of state institutions and the lack of rule of law can create fertile ground for the emergence of extremist groups that are willing to resort to violence to further their goals. Another factor contributing to the increase in terrorism is religious strife and extremism. The ideology of radical Islam is often used to justify terrorist attacks, attracting the support of vulnerable and religiously minded people. Religious leaders who espouse fanatical views may instill in their followers the idea of holy war against perceived enemies, which can lead to terrorist attacks and massacres. Also worth noting are economic factors that may lead to an increase in terrorist activity. Poverty, unemployment and inequality often create the conditions for the growth of extremist movements, which can attract those seeking justice and affirmation. Economic failures can cause public anger and dissatisfaction, which in turn can be used by extremists to increase their influence. In general, events and experiences that I agree to cause increased terror
