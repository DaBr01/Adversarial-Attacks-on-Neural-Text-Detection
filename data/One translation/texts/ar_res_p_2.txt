Terrorism is a dangerous phenomenon that threatens peace and security in the world, and recent years have witnessed a noticeable increase in the number of terrorist attacks in various parts of the world. There are many events and experiences that I support and believe contribute to the increase in the phenomenon of terrorism, and in this research I will analyze some of these reasons. One of the factors contributing to the increase in terrorism is poverty and unemployment. Young people who live in difficult economic conditions become more vulnerable to ideas of extremism and terrorism. In the absence of adequate employment and education opportunities, these deviant youth may find refuge in terrorist groups that fill their heads with dangerous ideas. Moreover, wars and armed conflicts play a major role in increasing terrorism. The poor economic conditions and lack of security resulting from wars make individuals search for a way to take revenge and express their anger, and this prompts them to resort to terrorist operations. Moreover, the media can play a major role in facilitating the spread of terrorism and fueling hatred. Negative media coverage of terrorist events and distortion of a certain image of communities increases the chances of recruiting more individuals to join terrorist groups. Finally, repressive constitutions and laws can contribute to an increase in terrorism, as suppression of freedoms and discrimination against certain groups can increase terrorism.
