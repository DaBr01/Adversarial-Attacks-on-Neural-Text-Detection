When it comes to academics, there is a common misconception that the students who always sit in the front row are the smartest. However, as a former backbencher myself, I must argue that backbenchers are actually the brains behind the operation. Allow me to delve into the reasons why backbenchers are, without a doubt, smarter than their front row counterparts.

First and foremost, backbenchers have mastered the art of multitasking. While the teacher drones on about the importance of calculus or the significance of Shakespearean sonnets, the backbenchers are busy honing their skills in the fine art of doodling. That's right, while the front row is diligently taking notes and paying attention, the backbenchers are exploring their creative side and letting their imaginations run wild. Who needs algebra when you can draw the Mona Lisa on the back of your notebook?

Furthermore, backbenchers are masters of deception. While the front row students are busy raising their hands and participating in class discussions, the backbenchers are perfecting their poker faces. They can nod along with the teacher's monologue while secretly thinking about what they're going to have for lunch or whether they left the stove on at home. Backbenchers are experts at appearing engaged and interested, even when their minds are miles away. It takes real skill to pull off such a convincing performance.

In addition, backbenchers have the gift of gab. While the front row students may excel in written assignments and test-taking, backbenchers are the kings and queens of verbal communication. They have a way with words that can charm even the crankiest of teachers. Backbenchers are quick-witted and always ready with a clever retort or a well-timed joke. Who needs an A+ when you can win over your teacher with a well-placed pun?

Moreover, backbenchers are the ultimate problem solvers. While the front row students may rely on memorization and rote learning to excel in their studies, backbenchers prefer to think outside the box. Backbenchers thrive on chaos and uncertainty, and they know how to navigate the twists and turns of academic life with ease. When faced with a difficult question or a challenging assignment, backbenchers don't panic â€“ they innovate. Who needs a textbook when you have a backbencher on your team?

In conclusion, it is clear that backbenchers are the unsung heroes of the academic world. They may not always follow the rules or conform to societal expectations, but their unique blend of creativity, cunning, and charm set them apart from their front row counterparts. So the next time you find yourself sitting in the back of the class, remember that you are among the intellectual elite. Embrace your inner backbencher and revel in the knowledge that you are, without a doubt, the smartest student in the room.
