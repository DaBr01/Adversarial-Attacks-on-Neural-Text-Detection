As a child, I always dreamed of having a sibling to play with and share my thoughts and experiences. Growing up as the youngest in a family of three siblings, I often felt left out and overshadowed by my older brothers. They were always busy with their own activities and had little time for me. 

It was during one cold winter night that my feelings of loneliness and neglect peaked. I had been playing by myself in my room, feeling the weight of my solitude crushing down on me. Tears welled up in my eyes as I tried to push away the overwhelming sense of isolation that had been building up inside me. I yearned for someone to understand me, to listen to me, to be there for me. 

In that moment of vulnerability, I found myself kneeling beside my bed, clasping my hands together in prayer. With a trembling voice, I whispered my deepest desire to a higher power. "Please, God, make me an only child," I pleaded. "I can't bear this feeling of loneliness anymore. I just want to feel loved and cherished. Please grant me the gift of being the sole focus of my parents' attention."

As I uttered those words, a sense of guilt washed over me. I loved my brothers, despite the times they had made me feel invisible. But in that moment of desperation, my heart ached for the love and care that only a parent could give. I longed for the undivided attention that I felt had been stolen from me by my siblings. 

For days after my prayer, I grappled with conflicting emotions. On one hand, I wanted to be the center of my parents' world, to have them all to myself. On the other hand, I felt guilty for wishing away the relationships that had shaped me and made me who I was. I missed the laughter and camaraderie that came with having siblings, the shared memories and inside jokes that only we understood. 

Despite my internal struggle, I couldn't shake the nagging feeling that being an only child would bring me the comfort and reassurance I so desperately craved. I yearned for the kind of attention that I saw my friends receive from their parents, the undivided love and support that seemed to be missing from my own life. 

In the end, my prayer went unanswered. I remained the youngest of three siblings, navigating the complexities of family dynamics and sibling relationships. But that night, as I poured my heart out in prayer, I learned a valuable lesson about the power of vulnerability and the importance of expressing one's deepest desires. I may not have gotten what I wished for, but in reaching out to a higher power, I discovered the strength and courage to confront my feelings of loneliness and insecurity. And for that, I was grateful.
