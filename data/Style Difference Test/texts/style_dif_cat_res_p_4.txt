The debate over the benefits of attending preschool has been ongoing for years. Some argue that preschool provides children with the necessary skills and foundation to succeed in school, while others believe that it is not necessary for a child's academic success. This paper will explore the research surrounding this topic and provide insight into whether children who attend preschool do better in school.

Numerous studies have been conducted to determine the impact of preschool on a child's academic success. According to a study by the National Institute for Early Education Research, children who attend preschool are more likely to develop better language and mathematics skills than those who do not attend. The study also found that preschool attendance was associated with higher reading and vocabulary scores in later school years.

Research has also shown that preschool can help children develop important social and emotional skills. A study published in the journal Child Development found that children who attended preschool were more likely to exhibit positive social behaviors compared to those who did not attend. Preschool can provide children with opportunities to interact with their peers, develop social skills, and learn how to regulate their emotions â€“ all of which are crucial for success in school.

Furthermore, preschool can help children develop important cognitive skills, such as problem-solving and critical thinking. A study published in the Journal of Research in Childhood Education found that children who attended preschool were more likely to exhibit higher levels of cognitive skills compared to their peers who did not attend. These skills are essential for academic success and can give children a strong foundation for learning in later years.

Despite the evidence supporting the benefits of preschool, there are still critics who argue that preschool is not necessary for academic success. Some believe that children can develop the same skills at home or in a non-preschool setting. However, research has shown that children who attend preschool are more likely to develop the necessary skills for school readiness, such as literacy and numeracy skills.

In conclusion, the research overwhelmingly supports the idea that children who attend preschool do better in school. Preschool can provide children with the necessary skills and foundation for academic success, as well as help them develop important social and emotional skills. While there may be critics who argue against the necessity of preschool, the evidence clearly shows the positive impact that preschool can have on a child's academic success. Therefore, it is important for parents and policymakers to recognize the benefits of preschool and ensure that all children have access to high-quality early childhood education programs.
