Growing up, my parents were always right in my eyes. They were the authority figures, the ones who knew better, and I trusted their judgment completely. However, as I got older and gained more life experiences, I started to question some of their decisions and beliefs. There was one particular experience that stands out to me as the moment when I realized that my parents weren't always right.

It was during my senior year of high school when I decided to apply to colleges. I had always been an excellent student, with good grades and extracurricular activities that I was passionate about. My parents had always emphasized the importance of education and had high expectations for me to attend a prestigious university. They had their sights set on Ivy League schools, convinced that this was the only path to a successful future.

I, on the other hand, had different aspirations. I wanted to attend a smaller, liberal arts college where I could pursue my interests in writing and literature. When I told my parents about my decision, they were less than thrilled. They argued that I was selling myself short by not aiming higher and that I would regret not attending a more prestigious school. Despite their concerns, I went ahead with my decision and applied to the colleges that felt like the right fit for me.

As the acceptance letters started rolling in, I was thrilled to see that I had been accepted to my dream school. I couldn't wait to start this new chapter in my life, but my parents were less than enthusiastic. They continued to express their disappointment in my decision, convinced that I was making a mistake. It was a tough time for our relationship, as I struggled to stand up for myself and assert my independence.

As I settled into college life and started pursuing my passion, I realized that my parents' expectations were not in line with my own values and goals. I found myself thriving in an environment that encouraged creativity and personal growth, rather than competition and prestige. I made lifelong friends, discovered new interests, and became more confident in my abilities as a writer. It was a transformative experience that solidified my belief in following my own path, regardless of others' opinions.

Looking back on that time, I can see that my parents weren't always right in their expectations for me. They had my best interests at heart, but they were projecting their own fears and insecurities onto me. I learned that it's essential to listen to my own intuition and follow my heart, even if it means going against the advice of those closest to me. This experience taught me the importance of trusting myself and my own judgment, even when others may doubt me.
