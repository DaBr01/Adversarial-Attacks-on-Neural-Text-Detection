In recent years, there has been a growing emphasis on the importance of inclusivity and accessibility in higher education. One of the key issues that has emerged in this context is whether universities should provide accommodations to disabled students. This essay will explore the arguments for and against this proposition, ultimately arguing that universities have a moral and legal obligation to provide accommodations to disabled students.

First and foremost, it is important to recognize that providing accommodations to disabled students is not just a matter of convenience or preference – it is a legal requirement. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, universities are required to provide reasonable accommodations to students with disabilities in order to ensure equal access to education. Failure to do so can result in legal action and sanctions against the institution. Therefore, universities have a legal obligation to provide accommodations to disabled students.

Moreover, providing accommodations to disabled students is not just a legal requirement – it is also a moral imperative. All students, regardless of their abilities or disabilities, have the right to access and benefit from higher education. By providing accommodations to disabled students, universities are fulfilling their moral duty to ensure that all students have equal opportunities to succeed academically and professionally. Denying accommodations to disabled students not only violates their rights, but also perpetuates discrimination and inequality in higher education.

Furthermore, providing accommodations to disabled students is not just a matter of compliance or ethics – it is also a matter of practicality. Research has shown that students with disabilities who receive accommodations are more likely to succeed academically and graduate from college. By providing accommodations such as extended time on exams, assistive technology, and accessible facilities, universities can help disabled students overcome barriers to learning and achieve their full potential. In doing so, universities are not only fulfilling their legal and moral obligations, but also investing in the success and well-being of their students.

On the other hand, some may argue that providing accommodations to disabled students is costly and burdensome for universities. While it is true that accommodations can require financial resources and administrative efforts, it is important to remember that universities have a responsibility to ensure equal access to education for all students, regardless of their disabilities. Moreover, research has shown that the benefits of providing accommodations to disabled students far outweigh the costs. By supporting the academic success and retention of disabled students, universities can enhance their reputation, diversity, and overall academic excellence.

In conclusion, universities should provide accommodations to disabled students. Not only is it a legal requirement, but it is also a moral imperative and practical necessity. By providing accommodations, universities can ensure equal access to education, support the success of disabled students, and promote inclusivity and diversity on campus. Ultimately, providing accommodations to disabled students is not just the right thing to do – it is the smart thing to do.
