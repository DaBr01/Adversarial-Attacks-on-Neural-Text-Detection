In recent years, there has been an increasing awareness of the importance of accessibility and inclusivity for all individuals, including those with disabilities. One area where this issue has gained particular attention is in higher education institutions, where disabled students may face unique challenges in accessing and participating in their academic programs. As a result, the question of whether universities should provide accommodations to disabled students has become a topic of debate.

One argument in favor of providing accommodations to disabled students is that it is essential for ensuring equal access to education. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) mandates that universities must provide reasonable accommodations for qualified students with disabilities in order to ensure that they have an equal opportunity to participate in all aspects of campus life. This means that universities are legally required to make adjustments or modifications to their policies, practices, and physical environments so that disabled students are not excluded from any aspect of the educational experience.

Additionally, providing accommodations can also benefit non-disabled students by fostering diversity and promoting a more inclusive campus environment. When universities make an effort to accommodate disabled students' needs, they send a message that all individuals are valued members of the community regardless of their abilities or limitations. This can help create a more welcoming atmosphere where everyone feels respected and accepted.

Furthermore, offering accommodations can also lead to improved outcomes for disabled students academically. By addressing barriers such as inaccessible buildings or materials not being available in alternative formats (e.g., braille), accommodations can allow these individuals to focus on learning rather than struggling against obstacles created by disability-related challenges.

On the other hand some critics argue against providing accommodation stating it may take away resources from other non-disabled populations or create unfair advantages for certain groups.
However; disadvantaging someone because they have different needs would be just as discriminatory as giving preferential treatment based on race /gender etc...

In conclusion; Universities should provide accommodation services
to allow every student full access capabilities which therefore increases diversity within college campuses . Providing Programs/services goes beyond meeting obligations under ADA law - It builds positive relationships between women/men who struggle due disability limitations AND able bodied people living life differently but equally deserving equitable opportunities Facilitating positive working Relations among like-brained folks!
