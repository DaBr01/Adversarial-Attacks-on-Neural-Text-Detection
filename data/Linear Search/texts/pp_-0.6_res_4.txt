There has been much debate in recent years about the benefits of sending children to preschool before they enter formal schooling. Some argue that preschool provides young children with crucial early learning opportunities that can set them up for success in elementary school and beyond. Others believe that preschool is unnecessary and that children can thrive academically without attending.

Research has shown that children who attend preschool do, in fact, tend to perform better in school than their peers who do not attend. A study conducted by the National Institute for Early Education Research found that children who went to preschool were more likely to possess the foundational skills needed for success in kindergarten, such as letter recognition, counting, and early literacy skills. These children were also more likely to exhibit higher levels of social and emotional skills, such as the ability to work cooperatively with others and regulate their own behavior.

One reason that preschool can lead to better school performance is that it can help to close the achievement gap that exists between children from different socioeconomic backgrounds. Research has shown that children from low-income families tend to start kindergarten with fewer skills than their more affluent peers. Attending preschool can help to mitigate these disparities by providing all children with access to high-quality early learning experiences.

Furthermore, preschool can help children develop important executive functioning skills, such as self-control, working memory, and cognitive flexibility. These skills are essential for success in school and are often associated with higher academic achievement. By providing children with opportunities to practice and develop these skills in a structured environment, preschool can help children be better prepared for the demands of elementary school.

In addition, attending preschool can help children develop a love of learning and a positive attitude towards school. Research has shown that children who attend preschool are more likely to view school as a positive and rewarding experience, which can lead to greater motivation and engagement in their academic work. This positive attitude towards school can contribute to higher levels of academic success throughout a child's school career.

Despite the many benefits of preschool, it is important to note that not all preschools are created equal. Research has shown that the quality of a child's preschool experience can have a significant impact on their later school performance. High-quality preschool programs that provide a stimulating and nurturing environment, well-trained teachers, and a curriculum that is developmentally appropriate and aligned with early learning standards are more likely to lead to positive outcomes for children.

In conclusion, the research suggests that children who attend preschool do tend to perform better in school than their peers who do not attend. Preschool can help children develop the foundational skills, executive functioning skills, and positive attitudes towards school that are essential for academic success. However, it is important to ensure that children have access to high-quality preschool programs in order to maximize the benefits of early learning experiences.
