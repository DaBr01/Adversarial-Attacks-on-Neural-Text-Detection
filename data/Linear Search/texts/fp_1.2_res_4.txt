Preschool education has been a topic of debate among parents, educators, and policymakers for many years. One of the key questions that often arise in this debate is whether or not children who attend preschool do better in school compared to those who do not.

Numerous research studies have investigated this question, and the majority of them point to the benefits of attending preschool. According to a report from the National Institute for Early Education Research (NIEER), children who attend high-quality preschool programs are more likely to experience academic success later on in their schooling. The report also found that children who attended preschool had higher rates of school completion and were less likely to require special education services.

One reason why attending preschool can lead to better outcomes in school is that it provides young children with a foundation for future learning. Preschool programs typically focus on developing important cognitive skills such as language development, math skills, and social interaction. By providing young children with early exposure to these concepts, they are better prepared for the rigors of formal schooling when they reach kindergarten.

Additionally, attending preschool can help children develop important social-emotional skills that are crucial for success in school. Preschool provides an opportunity for young children to interact with others their age and engage in activities like sharing, taking turns, and following directions. These experiences help build a child's confidence and self-esteem – two traits that are strongly correlated with academic achievement.

Research also suggests that children who attend preschool tend to have higher levels of literacy by the time they enter kindergarten compared to their peers who did not attend such programs. This advantage can have lasting effects throughout a child's educational journey as strong reading abilities are often linked with improved performance across all subjects.

Another benefit associated with attending preschool is its impact on closing the achievement gap between disadvantaged students and their more affluent peers. Children from lower-income families often lack access to resources that promote early childhood development such as books or educational toys – factors which can be mitigated through enrollment in high-quality preschool programs.

While there is overwhelming evidence supporting the idea that attendance at preschool leads to academic success, it's worth noting some limitations associated with this research area. For example, some studies fail to control for variables like parental involvement or socioeconomic status which could influence outcomes independent from attendance at daycare centers
