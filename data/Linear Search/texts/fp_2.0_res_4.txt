Preschool is often seen as an important step in a child's educational journey. Many parents choose to enroll their children in preschool to help them develop key skills that will prepare them for success in school and beyond. But does attending preschool actually lead to better academic outcomes? This question has been the subject of much research and debate.

One study conducted by the National Institute for Early Education Research (NIEER) found that children who attended high-quality preschool programs were more likely to enter kindergarten with stronger pre-reading, language, and math skills than those who did not attend preschool. The study also found that students who had attended high-quality preschool programs were less likely to need special education services or be held back a grade later on.

Another study published in the journal Child Development looked at data from over 1,000 children and found that those who had attended preschool performed better on tests of reading comprehension, vocabulary, math, and problem-solving skills compared to their non-preschool counterparts. The researchers concluded that attending a quality early childhood education program can have long-lasting positive effects on academic achievement.

Additionally, research has shown that attending preschool can improve social-emotional development in young children. Preschool provides opportunities for kids to learn how to interact with peers, practice sharing and taking turns, develop empathy towards others' feelings,and build self-regulation skills.This strong foundation sets them up for success both academicallyand socially when they enter elementary school.
