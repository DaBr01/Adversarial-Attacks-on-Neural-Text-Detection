Technology and gadgets have become an integral part of daily life for children, impacting various aspects of their lives, including their studies. While technology has the potential to enhance learning and provide new opportunities for education, it also presents challenges and distractions that can negatively impact children's academic performance.

One of the main ways in which technology affects children's studies is through increased access to information. With just a few clicks, students can find vast amounts of information on any topic they are studying. This can be incredibly beneficial for research projects and assignments, as it allows students to access a wide range of resources quickly and easily. However, this easy access to information has also led to concerns about the quality and reliability of sources that children are utilizing for their studies.

Another way in which technology impacts children's studies is through online learning platforms and educational apps. These tools can provide personalized learning experiences that cater to each child's individual needs and learning style. They can also make learning more engaging and interactive, helping students stay motivated and focused on their studies. However, there are concerns about the overreliance on these platforms leading to a lack of critical thinking skills and problem-solving abilities.

Technology also plays a significant role in how children manage their time when it comes to studying. With smartphones, tablets, laptops, smartwatches, and other gadgets constantly at their fingertips, it is easy for students to become distracted by social media, games, or other non-educational content. This constant connectivity can make it challenging for children to focus on their schoolwork without being interrupted or tempted by distractions.

Moreover, excessive screen time from using gadgets can have negative effects on children's health which ultimately impacts their ability to study effectively. Research has shown that too much screen time can lead to eye strain, disrupted sleep patterns, decreased physical activity levels,,  obesity ,and other health issues in kids.
