Preschool education has become a common part of early childhood development in many countries around the world. It is widely believed that children who attend preschool are better prepared for formal education and have better academic outcomes in the future. This essay will explore the research evidence on the topic of whether children who attend preschool do better in school.

One of the key benefits of preschool education is the development of important cognitive and social skills. According to research, children who attend preschool are more likely to have better language skills, cognitive abilities, and social skills compared to those who do not attend preschool. For example, a study by the National Institute for Early Education Research (NIEER) found that children who attended high-quality preschool programs had better language and math skills in kindergarten compared to children who did not attend preschool.

Preschool education also has a positive impact on school readiness. Children who attend preschool are more prepared for the formal school environment, have a better understanding of routines, and are more likely to have the social and emotional skills needed to succeed in school. Research shows that children who attend preschool are less likely to have behavioral problems in school and are more likely to have positive relationships with their teachers and peers.

Furthermore, preschool education can have long-term benefits for academic achievement. Research studies have found that children who attend preschool are more likely to graduate from high school, attend college, and have higher academic achievement compared to those who do not attend preschool. For example, a study by the HighScope Perry Preschool Project found that children who attended a high-quality preschool program had higher high school graduation rates, higher college enrollment rates, and higher earnings in adulthood compared to those who did not attend preschool.

However, it is important to note that the quality of preschool education plays a crucial role in determining the outcomes for children. Research has shown that high-quality preschool programs have greater benefits for children compared to low-quality programs. High-quality preschool programs typically have well-trained teachers, a stimulating and engaging curriculum, and a supportive learning environment. On the other hand, low-quality preschool programs may not have the same positive impact on children's academic outcomes.

In conclusion, the research evidence suggests that children who attend preschool are more likely to do better in school compared to those who do not attend preschool. Preschool education has a positive impact on children's cognitive and social skills, school readiness, and long-term academic achievement. However, the quality of preschool education is a key factor in determining the outcomes for children. High-quality preschool programs are more likely to have positive effects on children's academic outcomes compared to low-quality programs.
