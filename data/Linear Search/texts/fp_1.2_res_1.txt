Universities are institutions of higher education that strive to provide equal opportunities for all students in pursuit of their academic and personal growth. However, there are still barriers that prevent certain groups of individuals from fully participating in the university experience. One such group is disabled students, who may face physical, sensory, cognitive, or mental health-related disabilities that require accommodations in order to level the playing field.

Disabled students face multiple challenges when it comes to accessing and participating in higher education. These challenges can range from physical barriers on campus to the need for specialized technology or support services. According to a report by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) in 2018, approximately 19% of undergraduate students reported having a disability. This percentage represents a significant portion of the student population that universities must address by providing appropriate accommodations.

One argument for why universities should provide accommodations to disabled students is rooted in principles of fairness and equality. Higher education is a fundamental right accessible to all individuals regardless of their background or abilities. By denying disabled students access to necessary accommodations, universities perpetuate discrimination and hinder their ability to succeed academically.

Furthermore, providing accommodations benefits not only disabled students but also enhances the overall educational experience for everyone on campus. When universities create an inclusive environment that accommodates diverse needs and perspectives, they foster a sense of community and promote understanding among all members.

Another reason why universities should provide accommodations is based on legal obligations outlined in laws such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. These regulations mandate that educational institutions receiving federal funding must make reasonable modifications or adjustments for disabled individuals unless doing so would fundamentally alter their programs or services.

Additionally, research suggests that providing proper accommodations can have positive outcomes for both individual student success and institutional excellence. A study published by The Journal Of Higher Education showed that academic achievement among disabled college students was significantly higher when they received appropriate support services compared to those who did not receive any assistance.

Despite these compelling arguments supporting the provision of accommodation services at universities â€“ some may argue against it citing concerns about costs associated with implementing such measures will increase tuition fees which could result negativley impacting non-disabled student body Also they might beleive these special treatments could give an advantage over other studnets

In conclusion,it's evident through various studies as well legal obligations established under ADA & Rehabilitation act calls Universities need accommodate specified needs whereas this poses many benefits not just benefiting disables but enhancing environment inclusion which bodes well educating wider community as whole.Protecting basic rights isn't just morally teneble rather legaly imperative assuring equlity amongst society.CREATED JUST FOR GUIDENCE AND INFORMATION.INFORMATION COULD BE ADDRESSES IF ARE SEEKING MORE DETAILED EXECUTION
