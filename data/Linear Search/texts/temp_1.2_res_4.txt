A quality preschool education has become an increasingly popular topic as parents, educators, and policymakers seek to ensure that children are prepared for success in school and beyond. One question that often arises in these discussions is whether children who attend preschool do better in school than children who do not. Research on this topic is mixed, with some studies suggesting a positive impact of preschool attendance on school performance while others find little to no significant difference. 

One study conducted by the National Institute for Early Education Research (NIEER) found that children who attended preschool performed better on standardized tests and had higher rates of high school graduation than those who did not attend preschool. The study also found that children who attended preschool were more likely to enroll in advanced courses upon entering high school and were less likely to require special education services. These findings suggest a clear positive impact of preschool attendance on academic success.

On the other hand, a study published in the Economics of Education Review found no significant difference in academic achievement between children who attended preschool and those who did not. The study, which analyzed data from a nationally representative sample of children, found that preschool attendance did not have a noticeable impact on test scores or high school graduation rates. 

These conflicting findings highlight the complexity of studying the impact of preschool attendance on school performance. Factors such as the quality of the preschool program, the home environment, and individual student differences can all influence the outcomes of such studies. 

One potential explanation for the mixed results in research on preschool attendance is the quality of preschool programs. High-quality preschool programs that provide a stimulating and nurturing environment, well-trained teachers, and developmentally appropriate curriculum are more likely to have a positive impact on children's school performance. Conversely, low-quality preschool programs that lack these important elements may have little to no effect on academic outcomes. 

Another factor to consider is the home environment in which the child grows up. Children who attend preschool are more likely to come from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, which can impact their academic success regardless of preschool attendance. Strong parental support, access to resources, and a stable home environment can all contribute to a child's success in school. 

In conclusion, the question of whether children who attend preschool do better in school is a complex one that requires consideration of multiple factors. While some studies suggest a positive impact of preschool attendance on academic achievement, others find little to no significant difference. Ultimately, the quality of the preschool program, the home environment, and individual student differences all play a role in determining the success of preschool attendees in school. Additional research is needed to further explore this topic and better understand the factors that contribute to children's academic success.
