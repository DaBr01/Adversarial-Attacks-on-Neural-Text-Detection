Terrorism is a complex global issue that has been steadily increasing over the past several decades. There are myriad of opinions and theories as to what causes the rise in terrorist activities, but it can generally be traced back to events and experiences that individuals or groups believe push them towards violence and extremism. In this essay, we will explore some of the events and experiences that I believe are contributing to the increase in terrorism.

One of the major events that has fueled terrorism in recent years is the illegal invasion of Iraq by the United States in 2003. The invasion not only resulted in the deaths of thousands of Iraqis, but it also destabilized the region, leading to the rise of extremist groups such as ISIS. This example underscores how initial actions by powerful nations can create ripple effects that have far-reaching consequences and breed further violence.

Systemic poverty and lack of resources are also significant factors that contribute to the increase in terrorism. In many parts of the world, people are subjected to economic inequality, lack of opportunities, and political corruption, which can breed feelings of hopelessness and resentment and drive them towards extremist ideology. The lack of access to education and opportunities is particularly concerning, as it limits people's ability to envision a better future for themselves or their communities, pushing them towards feeling marginalized and disconnected from society.

A sense of injustice and discrimination is another important experience that can lead individuals to turn to terrorism. Discrimination based on race, religion, ethnicity, or gender can foster feelings of anger and resentment in individuals, leading them to turn to extremist groups that promise a sense of belonging and empowerment. Recent studies have shown that individuals who feel they have been unjustly marginalized or discriminated against are more likely to resort to violent actions in response.

Lastly, the use of social media and online platforms to spread extremist ideology and recruit new members has been a significant contributor to the rise in terrorism. The internet has provided extremist groups with easy access to vast audiences, allowing for the rapid spreading of dangerous ideas and propaganda. The use of online platforms to facilitate radicalization has made it more difficult for authorities to monitor and control the spread of extremist ideology, increasing the potential for terrorist attacks.

In conclusion, the increase in terrorism can be attributed to a combination of events and experiences that push individuals towards joining extremist groups and engaging in violent actions. Addressing these root causes requires a multifaceted approach that includes addressing economic inequality, promoting education and opportunities, minimizing discrimination, and regulating online platforms that provide a medium for extremist ideologies to thrive. By understanding and acknowledging the events and experiences driving terrorism, we can work towards creating a more peaceful and stable world for all.
