There is a growing body of research that suggests children who attend preschool perform better academically in later years compared to those who do not. Preschool provides children with a structured learning environment that helps them develop important skills and behaviors that are necessary for success in school.

Several studies have found that children who attend preschool have higher academic achievement in areas such as reading and math compared to those who do not attend preschool. A study conducted by the National Institute for Early Education Research (NIEER) found that children who attended preschool were more likely to read at their grade level by third grade than those who did not attend preschool. This is likely due to the fact that preschool helps children develop early literacy skills, such as phonemic awareness and vocabulary, which are important for reading success.

In addition to academic achievement, preschool also helps children develop social and emotional skills that are important for success in school. Preschool provides children with opportunities to interact with peers and learn how to work collaboratively with others. Children who attend preschool are more likely to have better social skills, such as sharing, taking turns, and resolving conflicts peacefully.

Furthermore, preschool helps children learn important self-regulation skills, such as following directions, staying focused on tasks, and managing their emotions. These skills are crucial for success in school, as they help children stay engaged in learning and behave appropriately in the classroom.

Another benefit of attending preschool is that it helps prepare children for the transition to kindergarten. Preschool provides children with a structured routine and introduces them to the expectations of school, such as following a schedule and listening to a teacher. This can help ease the transition to kindergarten and reduce the likelihood of behavior problems or academic struggles.

While there is strong evidence supporting the benefits of attending preschool, it is important to note that not all preschool programs are created equal. High-quality preschool programs, which have well-trained teachers, small class sizes, and a developmentally appropriate curriculum, tend to produce better outcomes for children than low-quality programs.

In conclusion, there is a significant body of research supporting the idea that children who attend preschool do better in school compared to those who do not. Preschool provides children with the academic, social, and emotional skills they need to succeed in school and beyond. However, it is crucial for policymakers and educators to ensure that all children have access to high-quality preschool programs in order to reap these benefits.
