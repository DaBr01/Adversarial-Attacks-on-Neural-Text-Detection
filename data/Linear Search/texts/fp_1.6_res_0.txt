Introduction

Children are exposed to a variety of media content from a young age, including cartoons. While many cartoons are innocent and designed for entertainment and education, some contain violence that can have negative impacts on children's behavior and development. This essay will explore the effects of violent cartoons on children.

Exposure to Violence in Cartoons

Cartoons have long been criticized for their portrayal of violence. Characters engaging in physical fights, using weapons, or displaying aggressive behavior are common themes in many popular animated series. Children who watch these shows may become desensitized to violence or develop aggressive tendencies themselves as they mimic what they see on screen.

Research has shown that exposure to violent media can lead to increased aggression in children. A study conducted by the American Academy of Pediatrics found that watching just one hour of television per day was associated with an increase in aggressive thoughts and behaviors among children aged three to five years old (Cantor & Wilson, 2019). When this television content contains violent imagery – such as characters hitting each other or using weapons – the impact is even greater.

Impact on Behavior

The impact of watching violent cartoons can manifest itself through changes in a child's behavior both immediately after viewing and over time. In the short term, children may imitate aggressive actions they see on TV during playtime or interactions with others. They may also become desensitized to violence and begin seeing it as normal or acceptable behavior.

Long-term effects include an increased likelihood of engaging in real-life aggression later on. A longitudinal study published by Ledingham et al., (2020) found that adolescents who were exposed to high levels of media violence during childhood were more likely to display antisocial behaviors such as bullying, fighting, and delinquency well into adolescence compared with those who had minimal exposure.

Psychological Effects 

In addition to influencing behavior patterns, exposure
to violent cartoons can also have negative psychological effects
on children’s mental health.
Repeatedly witnessing acts
of aggression could contribute 
to feelings 
of fear,
anxiety,
and desensitization.
Moreover,
children might struggle 
with internalizing
the values portrayed
in these programs if there is no counterbalance provided by adult figures explaining right from wrong.
