In recent years, there has been a growing awareness of the importance of inclusivity and accessibility in higher education. One group that has often been overlooked in this regard is disabled students. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, there were approximately 2.7 million students with disabilities enrolled in postsecondary institutions in the United States in 2017. Despite this significant number, many universities still do not provide adequate accommodations for disabled students. This raises the question: should universities provide accommodations to disabled students?

The answer to this question is a resounding yes. Providing accommodations to disabled students is not only a legal requirement under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), but it is also a moral imperative. Disabled students face unique challenges in higher education, and it is the responsibility of universities to ensure that they have equal access to education.

One of the main arguments in favor of providing accommodations to disabled students is that it promotes diversity and inclusivity on campus. By making accommodations available, universities create a more welcoming and supportive environment for all students, regardless of their abilities. This can help to foster a sense of community and belonging among disabled students, and can also help to break down stereotypes and misconceptions about disability.

Furthermore, providing accommodations to disabled students can have a positive impact on their academic success. Many disabled students face barriers to learning that their non-disabled peers do not, such as physical barriers, communication barriers, and learning disabilities. By providing accommodations such as accessible classrooms, assistive technology, and alternative testing formats, universities can help to level the playing field for disabled students and give them the support they need to succeed academically.

In addition to promoting inclusivity and academic success, providing accommodations to disabled students is also a legal requirement under the ADA. The ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in all aspects of public life, including education. This means that universities are required by law to provide reasonable accommodations to disabled students in order to ensure equal access to education. Failure to do so can result in legal action and financial penalties for the university.

Despite the legal and moral imperative to provide accommodations to disabled students, many universities still fall short in this regard. Some universities may cite budget constraints or logistical challenges as reasons for not providing accommodations, but these are not valid excuses. Universities have a responsibility to ensure that all students have equal access to education, and they must make accommodations a priority.

In conclusion, universities should provide accommodations to disabled students. Doing so promotes diversity and inclusivity, supports academic success, and fulfills a legal obligation under the ADA. By making accommodations available, universities can create a more inclusive and supportive environment for all students, regardless of their abilities. It is time for universities to prioritize the needs of disabled students and ensure that they have equal access to education.
