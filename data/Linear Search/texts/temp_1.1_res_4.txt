Attending preschool has long been a topic of debate among parents, educators, and policy makers. Some argue that preschool is essential for a child's academic success, while others believe that it is not necessary and that children can thrive without it. In this essay, I will explore the question: do children who attend preschool do better in school?

Research has shown that preschool can have a significant impact on a child's academic success. According to a study conducted by the National Institute for Early Education Research (NIEER), children who attended preschool were more likely to enter kindergarten with the skills necessary for success, such as knowing their alphabet, numbers, and shapes. They were also more likely to perform well in reading and math assessments in later grades. This suggests that preschool can provide children with a strong foundation that helps them succeed academically.

Furthermore, preschool can also have social and emotional benefits for children. Research has shown that children who attend preschool are better able to regulate their emotions and interact with their peers. These social skills are essential for success in school, as children need to be able to work well with others and navigate social interactions. Preschool can provide children with a structured environment where they can learn and practice these skills, setting them up for success in later grades.

In addition to academic and social benefits, attending preschool can also have long-term effects on a child's educational outcomes. Research has shown that children who attend preschool are more likely to graduate from high school and attend college. This suggests that preschool can have a positive impact on a child's overall academic trajectory, setting them up for success later in life.

However, it is important to note that the benefits of preschool can vary depending on the quality of the program. Research has shown that high-quality preschool programs, which have well-trained teachers, small class sizes, and a rigorous curriculum, are more likely to have a positive impact on children's academic success. On the other hand, low-quality preschool programs may not provide the same benefits and may even have a negative impact on children's development.

In conclusion, research suggests that children who attend preschool are more likely to do better in school. Preschool can provide children with the academic, social, and emotional skills necessary for success in later grades, setting them up for success in school and beyond. However, it is important to ensure that children are attending high-quality preschool programs in order to reap the full benefits of early education. Ultimately, the decision to send a child to preschool should be based on the individual needs and circumstances of the child, but the research indicates that attending preschool can have a positive impact on a child's academic success.
