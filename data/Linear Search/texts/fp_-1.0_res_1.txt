Universities play a crucial role in providing education to students from all walks of life. However, one group of students that often face barriers to receiving a quality education are those with disabilities. According to a report by the National Center for Education Statistics, students with disabilities make up a significant portion of the student population in higher education, with approximately 19% of undergraduate students reporting a disability. Given the prevalence of disabilities among students, the question of whether universities should provide accommodations to disabled students is a pressing one.

There are a few key arguments in favor of universities providing accommodations to disabled students. One of the most important of these is the legal mandate to do so. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, universities are legally required to provide students with disabilities the necessary accommodations to ensure equal access to education. Failure to do so can result in the university facing legal repercussions. By providing accommodations to students with disabilities, universities are not only fulfilling the legal requirements, but also upholding the principles of equality, access, and inclusion in education.

Additionally, the provision of accommodations to students with disabilities is a matter of social justice. Disabled students, like their non-disabled peers, have the right to a quality education, to the fullest of the studentsâ€™ abilities, to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to the to
