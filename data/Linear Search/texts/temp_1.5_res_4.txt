Children who attend preschool have been shown to benefit academically, socially, and emotionally from the experience. Research consistently demonstrates that children who attend preschool are more likely to do better in school compared to those who do not attend. Preschool provides children with a springboard into their academic journey, setting a strong foundation for future success.

One of the biggest reasons why children who attend preschool perform better in school is that they are exposed to early learning experiences. Preschool curriculum is designed to promote cognitive development, language acquisition, and problem-solving abilities. This early exposure to academic skills puts preschoolers at an advantage when they start formal schooling. A study conducted by Claire R. Morris found that children who attended preschool entered kindergarten with significantly higher early reading and math scores compared to their peers who did not attend preschool.

Furthermore, preschool helps children develop important social and emotional skills that are crucial for success in the classroom. In a preschool setting, children learn how to interact with their peers, share toys, take turns, and solve conflicts peacefully. These social skills not only foster positive relationships with classmates but also contribute to a more positive learning environment. Research shows that preschoolers who have developed strong social-emotional skills have better self-regulation and are more engaged in the academic tasks presented to them. This increased engagement often leads to higher academic achievement in elementary school and beyond.

Another benefit of attending preschool is the exposure to organized learning environments. In preschool, children are introduced to structured routines and daily schedules that mimic those of a typical elementary school day. This exposure helps children adapt to the expectations of formal schooling, such as following instructions, completing tasks independently, and staying focused during lessons. Research by Jacob A. Cair added that children who attended preschool have a smoother transition to kindergarten and are more confident in classroom settings.

It is also important to note that the benefits of preschool extend beyond individual academic achievement. Studies have shown that preschool attendance has a positive impact on communities and society as a whole. Children who attend preschool are less likely to repeat grades, require special education services, or drop out of school later on. This reduced need for costly interventions not only saves taxpayer dollars but also leads to a more educated workforce and a stronger economy.

In conclusion, the research is clear in showing that children who attend preschool do better in school compared to those who do not attend. Preschool provides children with valuable early learning experiences, social and emotional skills, exposure to structured environments, and a smoother transition to formal schooling. By investing in preschool education, we are helping to create a future generation of successful and well-rounded individuals who will contribute positively to society.
