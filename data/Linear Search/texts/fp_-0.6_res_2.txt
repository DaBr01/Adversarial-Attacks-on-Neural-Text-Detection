Terrorism is a global issue that continues to be a major concern for governments and citizens around the world. While there are numerous factors that contribute to the increase in terrorism, there are certain events and experiences that I believe play a significant role in fueling this issue. In this essay, I will discuss some of the key events and experiences that I believe are causing the increase in terrorism.

One of the primary factors that is contributing to the increase in terrorism is the rise of extremist ideologies. Extremist groups such as ISIS and Al-Qaeda have been able to recruit and radicalize individuals around the world through the use of social media and the internet. These groups promote a violent and hateful ideology that attracts individuals who are looking for a sense of purpose and belonging. The spread of extremist ideologies has led to the radicalization of individuals who are willing to commit acts of terrorism in the name of their cause.

Another factor that is fueling the increase in terrorism is the ongoing conflict and instability in the Middle East. The region has been plagued by violence and conflict for decades, and the power vacuums that have been created as a result of the Arab Spring and the Iraq and Afghanistan wars have allowed extremist groups to flourish. The lack of governance and the presence of sectarian and ethnic tensions in the region have created the perfect breeding ground for the growth of terrorism.
