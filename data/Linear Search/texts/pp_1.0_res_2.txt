Terrorism is a complex and multifaceted issue that continues to pose a significant threat to global security. While there are many factors that contribute to the increase in terrorism, several events and experiences can be pointed out as key catalysts for this trend.

One of the major events that have contributed to the rise of terrorism is the invasion of Iraq by the United States and its allies in 2003. The invasion was widely seen as an act of aggression and a violation of Iraq's sovereignty, which led to widespread outrage and resentment among Muslims around the world. Many individuals and groups viewed the invasion as evidence of Western imperialism and a justification for violence against perceived aggressors.

The subsequent occupation of Iraq further fueled anti-Western sentiments and provided a breeding ground for extremist ideologies. The power vacuum left by the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime allowed groups like Al-Qaeda and later ISIS to establish a presence in the region, leading to a sharp increase in terrorist attacks both in Iraq and beyond.

Another event that has played a significant role in the increase in terrorism is the Syrian civil war, which began in 2011. The conflict has attracted a wide range of foreign fighters, including those affiliated with extremist groups like ISIS, who have exploited the chaos and instability to advance their own agendas. The brutal tactics employed by these groups, including mass killings and the use of chemical weapons, have further radicalized individuals and inspired acts of terrorism around the world.

In addition to these events, experiences of discrimination and marginalization have also been identified as contributing factors to the increase in terrorism. Many individuals who become involved in terrorist activities come from marginalized communities where they face discrimination, economic hardship, and social exclusion. These individuals may feel alienated and disenfranchised, leading them to seek belonging and purpose through extremist ideologies.

Furthermore, the rise of social media and online propaganda has played a significant role in radicalizing individuals and promoting terrorist activities. Extremist groups like ISIS have used social media platforms to recruit new members, disseminate propaganda, and inspire attacks on Western targets. The ease and anonymity of online communication make it difficult for authorities to monitor and prevent such activities, leading to an increase in homegrown terrorism.

In conclusion, the increase in terrorism can be attributed to a combination of events and experiences that have shaped the global landscape in recent years. The invasion of Iraq, the Syrian civil war, discrimination and marginalization, and the rise of social media have all played a role in fueling extremism and violence. Addressing these root causes will require a multifaceted approach that addresses political, economic, social, and technological factors in order to effectively combat terrorism and promote peace and stability.
