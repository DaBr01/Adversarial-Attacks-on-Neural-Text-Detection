The question of whether children who attend preschool do better in school has been a topic of interest for educators, policymakers, and parents for many years. Proponents of early childhood education argue that preschool can have significant long-term benefits for children’s academic success, while skeptics question whether the benefits of attending preschool justify the costs.

Research on the topic generally finds that children who attend preschool tend to have higher academic achievement later in school compared to those who do not attend preschool. A study conducted by the National Institute for Early Education Research (NIEER) found that children who attended high-quality preschool programs scored higher on standardized tests, were more likely to graduate from high school, and were less likely to require special education services.

One reason why preschool attendance may improve children’s academic outcomes is that it provides them with a foundation of basic skills that are critical for success in primary school. Early childhood education programs often incorporate activities that promote cognitive development, language skills, and social-emotional skills, all of which are important for academic success. Thus, children who attend preschool may have a head start in developing the skills needed to learn to read, write, and do math.

Additionally, attending preschool can help children to develop important social and emotional skills that are critical for school success. Preschool provides children with opportunities to interact with peers, build relationships, and learn how to follow rules and routines. These social skills are important for classroom behavior and can help children to form positive relationships with teachers and peers, which can in turn support their academic achievement.

Furthermore, attending preschool can help to narrow the achievement gap between children from different socioeconomic backgrounds. Research has shown that children from low-income families are less likely to have access to high-quality early childhood education programs, which can put them at a disadvantage academically. By providing all children with access to preschool, policymakers can help to level the playing field and ensure that all children have the opportunity to succeed in school.

However, it is important to note that not all preschool programs are created equal. Research has shown that the quality of the preschool program, as well as the qualifications of the teachers, play a critical role in determining the benefits that children will experience. High-quality preschool programs that provide well-trained teachers, a curriculum focused on child development, and opportunities for parent involvement are more likely to have long-term benefits for children than low-quality programs.

In conclusion, research suggests that children who attend preschool do better in school compared to those who do not attend preschool. Early childhood education programs can help children to develop critical skills, such as cognitive, language, social, and emotional skills, that are important for academic success. By providing all children with access to high-quality preschool programs, policymakers can help to promote academic achievement and narrow the achievement gap.
