Preschool education has been a topic of interest and debate among researchers, educators, and parents for many years. The question of whether or not children who attend preschool do better in school is a significant and complex one. Numerous studies have been conducted in an attempt to answer this question. This essay will delve into the research surrounding the effects of preschool attendance on academic success.

First and foremost, it is essential to define what is meant by "doing better in school." Academic success can encompass various aspects, including grades, standardized test scores, attendance rates, and graduation rates. Research has indicated that children who attend preschool are more likely to excel in these areas compared to their counterparts who do not.

A study conducted by the National Institute for Early Education Research (NIEER) found that children who attend high-quality preschool programs show significant improvement in reading, math, and social skills. These gains have been shown to persist throughout elementary school and even into high school. The study also found that children who attend preschool are less likely to require special education services, are more likely to graduate from high school, and are more likely to pursue higher education.

Another study published in the Journal of Educational Psychology found that children who attended preschool had better reading and math skills in kindergarten compared to those who did not attend. The study also found that the benefits of preschool attendance were particularly pronounced for children from low-income families.

Furthermore, a meta-analysis conducted by the Brookings Institution in 2017 found that children who attended preschool had higher scores on standardized tests, were more likely to be on grade level in reading and math, and were less likely to be held back a grade. The study concluded that high-quality preschool programs have a positive impact on academic achievement.

However, it is essential to note that not all preschool programs are created equal. The quality of the program plays a significant role in determining its effectiveness. High-quality preschool programs are characterized by qualified and experienced teachers, small class sizes, a well-rounded curriculum, and a focus on social and emotional development. Research has shown that children who attend high-quality preschool programs benefit the most in terms of academic success.

In conclusion, the research overwhelmingly supports the idea that children who attend preschool are more likely to do better in school. High-quality preschool programs have been shown to have a positive impact on academic achievement, reading and math skills, graduation rates, and future educational pursuits. It is crucial for policymakers, educators, and parents to prioritize early childhood education and ensure that all children have access to high-quality preschool programs.
