Events and experiences I agree are causing the increase in terrorism are varied and complex. Despite efforts to combat terrorism, the global threat continues to escalate, with numerous factors contributing to its rise. In this essay, I will discuss some of the key events and experiences that are fueling the increase in terrorism.

One factor that has played a significant role in the increase in terrorism is the rise of extremist ideology. Over the past few decades, the number of terrorist organizations and individuals espousing extremist views has grown significantly. According to a report by the Global Terrorism Database, the number of terrorist attacks worldwide has increased by +15% in the past five years alone. Radicalization through online propaganda and social media platforms has made it easier for extremist groups to recruit new members and carry out attacks.

Additionally, the ongoing conflicts and political instabilities in the Middle East and other regions have also contributed to the increase in terrorism. The Syrian Civil War, for example, has been a breeding ground for various terrorist groups, including ISIS and Al-Qaeda. The continued violence and displacement of people in the region have created a fertile environment for radicalization and recruitment. In fact, in 2021 alone, there were over 8,500 terrorist attacks in the Middle East, resulting in thousands of deaths.

Furthermore, the availability of weapons and funding for terrorist groups has also contributed to the rise in terrorism. The illicit arms trade and the flow of funds from various sources have enabled terrorist organizations to carry out sophisticated attacks on a global scale. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the global arms trade is estimated to be worth over $80 billion annually, with a significant portion of these weapons ending up in the hands of terrorist groups.

Another contributing factor to the increase in terrorism is the failure of governments to address underlying issues such as poverty, inequality, and discrimination. Studies have shown that countries with high levels of poverty and social inequality are more susceptible to terrorist activities. In fact, according to the World Bank, over 80% of the world's poorest people live in regions affected by conflict and violence, making them easy targets for radicalization.

In conclusion, the increase in terrorism can be attributed to a combination of factors, including the rise of extremist ideology, ongoing conflicts, the availability of weapons and funding, and the failure of governments to address underlying issues such as poverty and inequality. Addressing these root causes will be crucial in combating terrorism and promoting peace and stability worldwide.
