As someone who has a disability myself, I believe that universities should provide accommodations to disabled students. Throughout my academic journey, I have encountered numerous challenges due to my disability, and having the necessary accommodations in place has made a significant difference in my ability to succeed in my studies.

In the real world, individuals with disabilities face unique obstacles that can make it difficult for them to access education and pursue their academic goals. This is where universities have an important role to play in ensuring that all students, regardless of their abilities, have equal opportunities to succeed.

For me, having accommodations such as extended exam times, note-taking services, and access to assistive technology has been crucial in helping me overcome the challenges posed by my disability. These accommodations have allowed me to fully engage in my classes, participate in discussions, and demonstrate my knowledge and skills through alternative means.

Furthermore, providing accommodations to disabled students not only benefits the individuals themselves but also contributes to creating a more inclusive and diverse campus community. When students with disabilities are supported and empowered to pursue their academic goals, they bring unique perspectives and experiences to the classroom, enriching the learning environment for everyone.

In addition to the moral imperative of supporting all students, providing accommodations to disabled students is also required by law. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) mandates that institutions of higher education must provide reasonable accommodations to ensure that students with disabilities have equal access to education. Failing to do so not only puts universities at risk of legal action but also perpetuates discrimination and exclusion against individuals with disabilities.

Some may argue that providing accommodations to disabled students is costly and resource-intensive for universities. While it is true that implementing accommodations may require financial investment and organizational efforts, the benefits far outweigh the costs. By investing in accommodations for disabled students, universities are investing in the future success and well-being of their students, as well as the overall diversity and inclusivity of their campus community.

In conclusion, I firmly believe that universities should provide accommodations to disabled students. As someone who has personally benefited from these accommodations, I have seen firsthand the positive impact they can have on the academic success and well-being of individuals with disabilities. By fulfilling their legal and moral obligations to support all students, universities can create a more inclusive and equitable learning environment for everyone.
