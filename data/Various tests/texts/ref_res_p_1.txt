Universities have a responsibility to provide accommodations for disabled students in order to ensure equal access to education for all individuals. Disabled students face unique challenges that can impact their ability to fully participate in the academic environment, and universities have a legal and ethical obligation to provide the necessary supports to address these barriers.

One of the primary arguments in favor of universities providing accommodations to disabled students is that it is required by law. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 mandates that colleges and universities must provide reasonable accommodations to enable disabled students to have equal access to education. According to Moore (2018), failure to provide these accommodations can be considered a violation of federal law and can result in legal action against the institution. Therefore, universities have a legal obligation to ensure that disabled students are not discriminated against and are able to fully participate in all aspects of campus life.

Moreover, providing accommodations to disabled students demonstrates a commitment to diversity and inclusivity within the university community. As argued by Eichhorn (2019), creating an environment that is welcoming and supportive of all individuals, regardless of their abilities, enhances the overall educational experience for everyone. By providing accommodations, universities are not only meeting their legal obligations but also embodying their core values of equity and social justice.

Additionally, accommodations for disabled students can lead to improved academic outcomes and retention rates. By addressing barriers to access and participation, disabled students are more likely to succeed academically and persist in their studies. Research conducted by Jones and Rosenthal (2017) found that students who receive accommodations for their disabilities have higher GPAs and are more likely to graduate compared to those who do not receive support. Therefore, providing accommodations is not only a legal and ethical imperative but also a practical strategy for promoting student success and retention.

Overall, universities should provide accommodations to disabled students to ensure equal access to education, comply with legal requirements, foster inclusivity, and promote academic success. By fulfilling this responsibility, universities can create a more diverse, equitable, and supportive learning environment for all students.
