In today's society, there is a growing emphasis on accessibility and inclusivity for all individuals, including those with disabilities. As the number of students with disabilities attending university continues to rise, the issue of providing accommodations for these students becomes increasingly important. This essay will explore the reasons why universities should provide accommodations to disabled students.

According to the National Center for Education Statistics, the number of college students with disabilities has more than tripled over the past three decades, from 2.6 percent in 1978 to 11.1 percent in 2016. This significant increase in the number of disabled students attending college highlights the importance of ensuring that these students have access to the necessary accommodations to succeed academically.

One of the main reasons why universities should provide accommodations to disabled students is to ensure equal access to education. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires that colleges and universities provide reasonable accommodations to allow students with disabilities to have equal access to educational opportunities. Failure to provide these accommodations can result in discrimination lawsuits and other legal consequences for the university.

Additionally, providing accommodations to disabled students has been shown to have a positive impact on their academic performance. A study conducted by the Institute for Disability Research and Training found that students who received accommodations for their disabilities had higher GPAs and were more likely to graduate on time compared to students who did not receive accommodations. This highlights the importance of providing accommodations to disabled students to help them succeed academically.

Furthermore, providing accommodations to disabled students can also benefit the university as a whole. A survey conducted by the National Center on Disability and Access to Education found that 87 percent of students with disabilities reported feeling more included and supported when they received accommodations from their university. This sense of inclusion can lead to higher retention rates and increased overall satisfaction among all students at the university.

Despite the benefits of providing accommodations to disabled students, there are still challenges that universities face in implementing these accommodations. Budget constraints and limited resources can make it difficult for universities to provide all the necessary accommodations for every disabled student. However, it is important for universities to prioritize funding for disability services to ensure that all students have equal access to education.

In conclusion, universities should provide accommodations to disabled students to ensure equal access to education, improve academic performance, and create a more inclusive campus environment. The increasing number of students with disabilities attending college highlights the importance of addressing this issue and making sure that all students have the resources they need to succeed. By providing accommodations to disabled students, universities can create a more diverse and supportive learning environment for all students.
