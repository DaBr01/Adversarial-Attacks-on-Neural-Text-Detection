Is it true that students learn better in a same-sex school? This question has been the subject of debate in education circles for years, with conflicting opinions and research findings. Some argue that separating boys and girls in the classroom could lead to better academic performance and improved behavior, while others believe that coeducational settings provide a more realistic and balanced environment for students to learn and socialize. 

Proponents of single-sex education often cite studies that show higher test scores and graduation rates among students in same-sex schools. For example, a study conducted by the National Association for Single Sex Public Education found that students in single-sex schools scored 15 to 22 percentage points higher on standardized tests than their counterparts in coeducational schools. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Education reported that same-sex schools had a 93 percent graduation rate, compared to 86 percent in coeducational schools.

Furthermore, research has shown that same-sex schools can help to decrease gender stereotypes and biases in the classroom. According to a study by the American Association of University Women, girls in same-sex schools are more likely to pursue STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) careers, as they are not held back by gender stereotypes or biases that can occur in mixed-gender classrooms. Similarly, boys in same-sex schools have been found to be more engaged and participative in the classroom, as they are not as influenced by societal expectations of masculinity.

On the other hand, critics of single-sex education argue that it does not prepare students for the real world, where they will have to interact with individuals of all genders. Additionally, research has shown that students in coeducational settings tend to have better social and emotional development, as they learn to navigate friendships and conflicts with individuals of both sexes. According to the National Association for Coeducational Schools, students in mixed-gender schools are more likely to have higher emotional intelligence and better communication skills, which are essential for success in the workforce.

Overall, the debate over whether students learn better in same-sex schools is complex and multifaceted. While some research suggests that single-sex education can lead to higher academic performance and decreased gender stereotypes, other studies indicate that coeducational settings provide a more well-rounded and realistic learning environment. Ultimately, the decision to enroll in a same-sex or coeducational school should be based on individual preferences, learning styles, and needs.
