The debate over whether schools should allow the use of smartphones in the classroom has been ongoing for many years. Some argue that smartphones are a valuable tool that can enhance the learning experience, while others believe that they are a distraction that hinders academic performance. In this essay, I will argue that schools should allow the use of smartphones in school because they can be used as a valuable educational resource, help improve communication between students and teachers, and better prepare students for the future.

First and foremost, smartphones can be a valuable educational resource in the classroom. With the advancement of technology, smartphones have become powerful tools that can provide students with access to a wealth of information at their fingertips. According to a study conducted by Pew Research Center, 92% of teens report going online daily, with 24% saying they are online "almost constantly" (Anderson & Jiang, 2018). This shows that students are already accustomed to using technology regularly, so incorporating smartphones into the classroom can help engage students and make learning more interactive.

Additionally, smartphones can help improve communication between students and teachers. With the use of messaging apps or email, students can easily ask questions, seek clarification, or receive feedback from their teachers outside of class time. This can help bridge the communication gap that often exists in a traditional classroom setting and ensure that students have the support they need to succeed academically.

Moreover, allowing the use of smartphones in school can better prepare students for the future. In today's digital age, technology is becoming increasingly prevalent in all aspects of society, including education and the workplace. By allowing students to use smartphones in school, they can develop the necessary skills to navigate and utilize technology effectively, which will be essential in their future careers.

In conclusion, schools should allow the use of smartphones in the classroom because they can be a valuable educational resource, help improve communication between students and teachers, and better prepare students for the future. By incorporating smartphones into the learning environment, schools can help engage students, foster communication, and equip them with the skills they need to succeed in the digital age.
