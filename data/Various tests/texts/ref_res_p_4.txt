Various studies have shown that children who attend preschool tend to perform better academically in later years compared to those who do not attend preschool. This essay will discuss the research findings on the impact of preschool attendance on children's academic success.

Firstly, attending preschool has been found to improve children's school readiness. A study conducted by Burchinal et al. (2000) found that children who attended preschool had higher cognitive and language skills, as well as better social and emotional development than children who did not attend preschool. This suggests that preschool attendance contributes to the development of crucial skills that are important for later academic success.

Furthermore, preschool attendance has been linked to higher academic achievement in later years. A longitudinal study by Reynolds et al. (2017) followed children from low-income families who attended preschool and found that they were more likely to graduate from high school, attend college, and have higher earning potential than their peers who did not attend preschool. This suggests that preschool attendance not only improves academic performance in the short term but also has long-term benefits on educational outcomes.

In addition, research has shown that children who attend preschool have higher levels of school engagement and motivation. A study by Yoshikawa et al. (2013) found that children who attended preschool were more likely to demonstrate positive attitudes towards school and have higher levels of motivation to learn. This indicates that preschool attendance not only improves academic skills but also promotes a positive attitude towards education, which is essential for academic success.

Moreover, attending preschool has been found to reduce the likelihood of children needing special education services later on. A study by Reynolds et al. (2019) found that children who attended preschool were less likely to require special education services in elementary school, highlighting the preventive benefits of preschool attendance on academic struggles.

In conclusion, the research evidence strongly supports the notion that children who attend preschool tend to do better in school. Preschool attendance has been shown to improve school readiness, academic achievement, school engagement, and reduce the likelihood of needing special education services. These findings underscore the importance of investing in early childhood education to set children on a path to academic success.
