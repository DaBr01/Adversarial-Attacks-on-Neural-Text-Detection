There are numerous events and experiences that are contributing to the increase in terrorism worldwide. One significant factor is the rise of extremist groups such as ISIS and Al-Qaeda, which have gained power and influence in recent years. These groups have been able to recruit followers and carry out attacks through social media and other online platforms. For example, according to a report by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), the use of social media by terrorist organizations has increased by 60% in recent years (Berrebi, 2017).

Additionally, the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Africa have created a breeding ground for terrorism. A study by the Institute for Economics and Peace found that countries experiencing conflict are more likely to have higher levels of terrorism (Global Terrorism Index, 2019). The instability and violence in these regions provide a conducive environment for terrorist groups to thrive and recruit new members.

Furthermore, the lack of effective government and security measures in some countries has also contributed to the increase in terrorism. A study by the RAND Corporation found that weak governance is a significant predictor of terrorism (RAND Corporation, 2017). In countries where there is corruption, human rights abuses, and ineffective law enforcement, terrorist organizations are able to operate with impunity and carry out attacks without consequence.

Moreover, the spread of radical ideologies and hate speech has played a role in fueling terrorist attacks. Extremist propaganda and rhetoric have been disseminated through various means, including social media, religious institutions, and online forums. This has led to the radicalization of individuals and the justification of violence in the name of a cause. According to a report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the promotion of extremist ideologies is a key factor in the recruitment of terrorists (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, 2018).

In conclusion, there are several events and experiences that are contributing to the increase in terrorism worldwide. The rise of extremist groups, ongoing conflicts, weak governance, and the spread of radical ideologies all play a role in creating a conducive environment for terrorism to thrive. It is essential for governments, civil society, and international organizations to work together to address these root causes and prevent further acts of terrorism.
