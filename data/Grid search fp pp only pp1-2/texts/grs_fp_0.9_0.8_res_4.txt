Attending preschool has become a common experience for children in many countries. Parents often see preschool as an important stepping stone to prepare their children for formal education. However, there is ongoing debate about the impact of preschool on academic success later in life. Some argue that attending preschool can give children a head start academically, while others contend that the benefits are minimal or even non-existent. This research essay aims to explore the question: do children who attend preschool do better in school?

Research studies have shown mixed results when it comes to the long-term effects of attending preschool on academic achievement. On one hand, several studies have found that children who attend preschool tend to perform better in school compared to those who do not attend. For example, a study by Duncan and Magnuson (2013) found that children who attended high-quality early childhood programs had higher reading and math scores in elementary school compared to those who did not attend such programs.

Furthermore, research conducted by Barnett et al. (2008) found that children who attended high-quality preschool programs were more likely to graduate from high school and pursue post-secondary education than those who did not attend such programs. These findings suggest that attending preschool can have long-lasting positive effects on educational outcomes.

On the other hand, some studies have found limited or no significant benefits of attending preschool on academic achievement. A study by Loeb et al. (2007) examined the effects of universal pre-kindergarten programs on student outcomes and found no significant differences in academic performance between students who attended these programs and those who did not.

Additionally, a meta-analysis conducted by Lipsey et al. (2015) reviewed several studies on the impact of early childhood education on academic achievement and concluded that while there were short-term benefits of attending preschool, these effects tended to fade over time.

It is also important to consider factors such as program quality and duration when examining the impact of preschool attendance on academic success. Research has repeatedly shown that high-quality early childhood education programs lead to better outcomes for children compared to low-quality or informal settings.

In conclusion, while some research suggests that attending preschool can lead to improved academic performance later in life, other studies have found limited or no significant benefits of early childhood education on educational attainment. It is clear that more research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of attending preschool on school success.

Ultimately, parents should consider various factors such as program quality, duration, and individual child needs when deciding whether or not to enroll their child in a pre-kindergarten program. By doing so thoughtfully based upon evidence-based decision-making strategies will enable them set their child up for future educational success regardless if they choose a traditional route involving enrolling their child n Preschool or choosing other alternatives such home-schooling etc..
