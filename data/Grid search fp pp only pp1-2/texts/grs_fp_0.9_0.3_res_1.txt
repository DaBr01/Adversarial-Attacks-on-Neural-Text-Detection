In recent years, the issue of providing accommodations to disabled students at universities has sparked debate among educators and policymakers. While some argue that universities have a moral obligation to support all students, regardless of their disability, others believe that these accommodations may give disabled students an unfair advantage over their peers. This essay will explore both sides of the argument and ultimately argue in favor of providing accommodations to disabled students.

Firstly, it is important to consider the ethical implications of denying accommodations to disabled students. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) mandates that universities must provide reasonable accommodations to individuals with disabilities in order to ensure equal access to educational opportunities. By failing to do so, universities risk violating federal law and perpetuating discrimination against disabled individuals.

Furthermore, providing accommodations for disabled students not only fulfills legal obligations but also promotes diversity and inclusivity on campus. Allowing disabled students equal access to education can help create a more inclusive learning environment for all students and foster a sense of community among the student body. Additionally, accommodating diverse learning needs can benefit all students by encouraging them to think beyond traditional teaching methods and embrace alternative approaches.

On the other hand, some critics argue that providing accommodations may give disabled students an unfair advantage over their peers. They claim that allowing extra time on exams or providing assistive technology could compromise academic integrity by altering the level playing field for all student
