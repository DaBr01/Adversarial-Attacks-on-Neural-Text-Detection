In recent years, there has been an increasing focus on providing equal access to education for all students, including those with disabilities. One key aspect of this is whether universities should provide accommodations to disabled students in order to ensure that they have the same opportunities and support as their non-disabled peers.

There are several arguments both for and against the provision of accommodations to disabled students by universities. Those in favor of such accommodations argue that it is a matter of equality and justice. All students, regardless of their physical or mental abilities, should have the right to pursue higher education and achieve their academic goals. Providing accommodations such as wheelchair ramps, sign language interpreters, or extended testing time allows disabled students to participate fully in classes and exams, giving them the same chance at success as their non-disabled peers.

Additionally, providing accommodations can help create a more inclusive campus environment where all students feel welcome and valued. By making changes to facilities and resources to accommodate disabled students' needs, universities can demonstrate their commitment to diversity and accessibility. This not only benefits individual disabled students but also contributes to a more positive learning environment for everyone on campus.

Furthermore, accommodating disabled students can lead to better educational outcomes overall. Research has shown that when disability-related barriers are removed from the learning process through accommodations, disabled students perform better academically and are more likely to complete their degrees. This benefits not only the individual student but also society as a whole by increasing representation of diverse perspectives within various professions.

On the other hand, some may argue against providing accommodations by claiming that it places an undue burden on universities' resources. They may argue that making physical changes or hiring additional staff members to provide support services for disabled students is costly and unfeasible for many institutions. However,it is important remember these institutions receive public funding which makes it imperative they make deliberate efforts towards inclusivity.
