Terrorism is a growing concern in today's society, with attacks happening around the world on a frequent basis. There are various factors that contribute to the increase in terrorism, including political unrest, social inequality, and religious extremism. In this essay, I will discuss events and experiences that I believe are causing the rise in terrorism.

One major event contributing to the increase in terrorism is the ongoing war on terror led by Western countries. The invasion of Iraq in 2003 and subsequent military operations in Afghanistan have fueled anti-Western sentiment among extremist groups such as ISIS and Al-Qaeda. These groups use these conflicts as propaganda tools to recruit new members and justify their violent actions against civilians. The continued presence of foreign troops in Muslim-majority countries has also worsened tensions between different religious groups and contributed to a sense of alienation among marginalized communities.

Social inequality is another factor that fuels terrorism. Many terrorist organizations exploit grievances related to poverty, lack of education opportunities, and discrimination to recruit individuals who feel disenfranchised from mainstream society. Economic disparities can create fertile ground for radicalization as people seek alternative ways to address their grievances and achieve a sense of purpose or belonging. In regions where there is high unemployment rates or limited access to basic services such as healthcare or education, individuals may be more susceptible to extremist ideologies that promise them a better future through violence.

Religious extremism plays a significant role in driving terrorist activities around the world. Groups like ISIS and Boko Haram use religion as a tool to justify their actions and recruit followers who view themselves as defenders of their faith against perceived threats. The rise of online platforms and social media has made it easier for these groups to spread their message globally and attract supporters from various backgrounds.

Furthermore, experiences of discrimination or prejudice can push individuals towards radical beliefs and actions. Islamophobia, xenophobia, racism, or other forms of intolerance can alienate vulnerable populations within societies and drive them into the arms of extremist groups who promise liberation or empowerment through violence.

In conclusion, there are multiple factors at play when considering why terrorism is on the rise globally: geopolitical conflicts, systemic inequalities perpetuated by economic disparity; exploitationof religeous beliefs by extremist group leaders; discrimination faced by certain minorities due largely causedby intoleranceDrivenamasjid targting mass shooting ,among others My research suggests that addressing root causes such as poverty,state-sanctioned militarization,and promoting inclusivityand multiculturalstm along with inter-faith dialogue would prove promising solutions inorder mitigatethe rising tidesofterrorism
