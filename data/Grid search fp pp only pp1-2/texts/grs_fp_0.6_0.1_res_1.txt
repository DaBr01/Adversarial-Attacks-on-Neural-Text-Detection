As society becomes more inclusive and diverse, the issue of accommodating disabled students in universities has gained increased attention. This raises the question: should universities provide accommodations to disabled students? 

First and foremost, it is important to recognize that providing accommodations to disabled students is not only a moral obligation but also a legal one. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in all areas of public life, including education. This means that universities are required by law to provide reasonable accommodations to disabled students in order to ensure equal access to education.

Furthermore, providing accommodations to disabled students benefits not only the individuals themselves but also society as a whole. By giving disabled students the support they need to succeed academically, universities are helping them reach their full potential and contribute their unique perspectives and talents to society. In other words, accommodating disabled students promotes diversity and inclusivity, both of which are essential for a healthy and vibrant academic community.

Moreover, research has shown that providing accommodations to disabled students can have a positive impact on their academic performance. A study conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics found that students with disabilities who received accommodations performed significantly better academically than those who did not receive any support. This suggests that providing accommodations can help level the playing field and give disabled students an equal opportunity to succeed in higher education.

On the other hand, some may argue that providing accommodations to disabled students can be costly and burdensome for universities. However, it is important to note that many accommodations for disabled students are relatively low-cost or even cost-neutral. For example, providing digital copies of textbooks or allowing extra time on exams can be done at minimal expense. Additionally, universities have a duty under the ADA to provide these accommodations regardless of cost.

In conclusion, universities should absolutely provide accommodations to disabled students. Not only is it required by law, but it is also the right thing to do from a moral and ethical standpoint. By ensuring equal access to education for all individuals, universities are promoting diversity and inclusivity while also helping disabled students reach their full potential academically. Providing accommodations may come with challenges and costs, but the benefits far outweigh any potential drawbacks. Ultimately, accommodating disabled students in higher education is essential for creating a more inclusive and equitable society for all.
