The topic of whether universities should provide accommodations to disabled students is a contentious one, with arguments on both sides. While some believe that providing accommodations puts undue strain on universities and gives disabled students an unfair advantage, others argue that it is the university's responsibility to ensure equal access to education for all students.

One of the main reasons why universities should provide accommodations to disabled students is in order to comply with anti-discrimination laws. In many countries, including the United States under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), universities are required by law to provide reasonable accommodations to disabled students. Failure to do so could result in legal consequences for the university. By providing accommodations, universities are also upholding their moral obligation to ensure that all students have an equal opportunity to succeed.

Furthermore, providing accommodations can greatly benefit disabled students' academic success. Accommodations such as extra time on exams, note-taking services, and assistive technology can help level the playing field for disabled students who may face additional challenges in their studies due to their disabilities. By providing these accommodations, universities can help ensure that all students have the chance to reach their full potential academically.

Moreover, providing accommodations can also be beneficial for the university as a whole. By creating an inclusive environment that supports disabled students, universities can attract a more diverse student body and improve their reputation as an institution that values diversity and inclusion. This can lead to increased enrollment from disabled students and enhance the overall learning experience for everyone on campus.

On the other hand, opponents of providing accommodations argue that doing so places an unfair burden on universities financially and logistically. They argue that accommodating every individual student's needs could be costly and detract resources away from other important areas of the university budget. Additionally, some may argue that providing accommodations gives disabled students an unfair advantage over non-disabled peers.

However, these arguments fail to recognize the importance of ensuring equal access to education for all students. Providing accommodations is not about giving someone an advantage; it is about leveling the playing field so that all individuals have equal opportunities for success. Furthermore, while there may be costs associated with providing accommodations, they are outweighed by the benefits of creating a more inclusive and diverse learning environment.

In conclusion, it is clear that universities should provide accommodations to disabled students in order to comply with anti-discrimination laws, promote academic success among all students, and create a more inclusive campus environment. While there may be arguments against providing accommodations based on financial concerns or perceived unfair advantages, these arguments do not hold up when considering the overarching goal of ensuring equal access to education for all individuals. Ultimately, by providing accommodations, universities can demonstrate their commitment to diversity and inclusivity while helping all students achieve their full potential academically.
