Introduction

The issue of whether universities should provide accommodations to disabled students is a complex and controversial one. On one hand, some argue that providing such accommodations is necessary in order to ensure that all students have equal access to education. On the other hand, others believe that making special accommodations for disabled students is unfair to other students and may lower academic standards. In this essay, we will explore both sides of the argument and discuss why it is important for universities to provide accommodations to disabled students.

Reasons Universities Should Provide Accommodations

One of the main reasons why universities should provide accommodations to disabled students is because it is required by law. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) mandates that colleges and universities make reasonable accommodations to ensure that individuals with disabilities have equal access to education. Failure to provide such accommodations could result in legal action being taken against the university.

Furthermore, providing accommodations for disabled students is not only required by law, but it also reflects the values of an inclusive and diverse society. By ensuring that all students have equal access to education, universities can create a more equitable learning environment where every individual has the opportunity to succeed.

In addition, providing accommodations for disabled students can help improve their academic performance and retention rates. By offering services such as note-taking assistance, extended time on exams, or accessible classroom materials, universities can help level the playing field for students with disabilities and enable them to reach their full potential.

Reasons Universities Should Not Provide Accommodations

Some argue that providing special accommodations for disabled students may create an unfair advantage over other non-disabled students. For example, allowing a student extra time on exams could be seen as giving them an unfair advantage over their classmates who are required to complete the exam within a set time limit.

Others believe that making special accommodations for disabled students may lower academic standards at universities. They argue that if certain requirements are waived or altered for disabled students, it may undermine the rigor of academic programs and devalue the degrees earned by all graduates.

Conclusion

In conclusion, while there are valid arguments on both sides of the debate, ultimately it is important for universities to provide accommodations to disabled students. By doing so, they not only comply with legal requirements but also promote values of inclusivity and diversity. Providing these services helps ensure that all individuals have equal access to education and enables them to achieve their full potential academically. It is crucial for universities to strike a balance between accommodating the needs of disabled students while maintaining academic standards and fairness among all student populations.
