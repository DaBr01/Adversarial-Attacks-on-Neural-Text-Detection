The use of smartphones, tablets, computers, and other electronic devices has become increasingly common among young people. While these tools can be beneficial for learning and education, they also come with potential downsides that can impact a child's studies.

This can lead to decreased productivity and lower academic performance. Additionally, the blue light emitted by screens can disrupt sleep patterns and negatively impact concentration levels during study sessions.

Spending long hours staring at screens can cause visual problems like digital eye strain or computer vision syndrome (CVS). In turn causing discomfort such as blurred vision or dry eyes - impacting student’s motivation towards studying.
