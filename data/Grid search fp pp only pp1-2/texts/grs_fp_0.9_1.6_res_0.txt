The debate surrounding the effects of violent cartoons on children has been a long-standing and contentious issue. Proponents argue that exposure to violent content in cartoons can have negative consequences on children's behavior, attitudes, and development. On the other hand, some experts believe that these concerns are overblown and that there is little evidence to suggest a direct link between violent cartoons and real-world aggression in children.

One of the main arguments against violent cartoons is that they can desensitize children to violence. Research has shown that prolonged exposure to violent media can numb individuals to violence, making them less empathetic towards others' sufferings or more tolerant of aggressive behavior. This desensitization effect may lead children to mimic violent behaviors they see in cartoons, as they become more accepting of such actions as normal or even entertaining.

Furthermore, studies have linked exposure to violent media with increased levels of aggression in children. A meta-analysis conducted by Anderson et al.(2003) found a significant correlation between viewing violent media and aggressive behavior among youth. The researchers concluded that repeated exposure to violence through various forms of media could contribute to an increase in aggressive thoughts and behaviors in children.

Another concern regarding the impact of violent cartoons on children is their potential influence on attitudes towards conflict resolution. Cartoons often portray violence as an effective means of solving problems or achieving goals without emphasizing non-violent alternatives such as communication, negotiation, or compromise. Children who watch these programs may internalize the idea that resorting to physical aggression is acceptable when faced with conflicts or challenges.

Moreover, research suggests that exposure to violent media can have lasting effects on cognitive processes related to attention and memory. Studies have shown that constant bombardment with fast-paced action sequences or scenes containing graphic violence can impair concentration, reduce impulse control，and interfere with information processing abilities．These cognitive deficiencies may manifest themselves in school performances poorer academic achievements.’
