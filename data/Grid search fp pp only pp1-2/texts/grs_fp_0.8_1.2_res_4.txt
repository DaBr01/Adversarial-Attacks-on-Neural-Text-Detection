Preschool education has become increasingly prevalent in the United States over the past few decades, with approximately 75% of children ages three to five attending some form of preschool. Despite its popularity, there is ongoing debate about whether preschool attendance actually helps children perform better in school.

Proponents of preschool argue that early childhood education can have a significant impact on a child's academic success. Research shows that children who attend high-quality preschool programs demonstrate higher levels of school readiness and achievement compared to those who do not attend preschool. These benefits can be attributed to the structured learning environment, social interactions with peers, and exposure to early literacy and numeracy skills that are typically offered in preschool settings.

Furthermore, studies indicate that children who attend preschool are more likely to develop important cognitive and socio-emotional skills necessary for academic success. For example, research has shown that preschool attendance is associated with improved language development, critical thinking skills, problem-solving abilities, and self-regulation—all of which are crucial for success in school. Additionally, interacting with diverse groups of children fosters social skills like cooperation, empathy, and communication.

On the other hand, critics of preschool argue that any short-term gains from attending early childhood education programs may be negligible in the long run. Some researchers contend that while attending preschool may provide a temporary boost during the early years of schooling, these advantages tend to fade over time as students progress through elementary school. This phenomenon is known as "fade-out," where initial gains from preschool diminish as students advance academically.

Moreover, skeptics raise concerns about potential negative effects associated with excessive formal schooling at an early age. Some believe that pushing young children into structured educational settings before they are developmentally ready could lead to stress or burnout later on in their academic careers. Critics also question whether standardized testing measures accurately capture the full range of outcomes associated with a child's educational experience—including creativity, problem-solving ability,social-emotional development,and lifelong learning habits—not just test scores.
