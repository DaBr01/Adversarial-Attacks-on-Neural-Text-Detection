When it comes to early childhood education, the debate on whether children who attend preschool do better in school continues to be a topic of interest among educators, parents, and researchers. Preschool is typically defined as an educational program designed for children between the ages of three and five years old before they enter kindergarten.

There are numerous studies that suggest attending preschool can have positive effects on a child's academic performance later in life. Research has shown that children who attend high-quality preschool programs tend to display higher levels of cognitive skills such as language development, math abilities, and literacy compared to those who do not attend preschool. In addition, these children also exhibit better social-emotional skills including improved self-regulation, cooperation with peers, and problem-solving abilities.

One study conducted by James Heckman et al., found that participating in quality preschool programs leads to several long-term benefits for children including higher graduation rates from high school, increased chances of pursuing higher education or training programs after high school, decreased likelihood of being involved in criminal activities later in life. The study found that investing in early childhood education yields greater returns than investments made at any other stage during an individual's life.

Another research study published by the National Institute for Early Education Research (NIEER) examined data from various states across the United States and concluded that children who attended state-funded pre-k programs had significantly higher scores on standardized tests compared to their peers who did not attend pre-k programs. This suggests that early access to structured learning environments can have a lasting impact on a child's academic outcomes.

In addition to cognitive and academic benefits, attending preschool can also help foster socialization skills and emotional well-being among young learners. Children learn how to interact with others successfully through play-based activities which promote teamwork, communication skills while building confidence within themselves.

Despite these numerous benefits associated with attending preschool; there are some limitations regarding its effectiveness as well. The quality of the program plays a significant role in determining its impact on student achievement. Low-quality or poorly structured pre-K programs may not provide the same level of benefits compared to high-quality programs led by trained teachers using evidence-based curriculum practices

Furthermore; some critics argue against mandatory attendance at age-appropriate biases towards those students frequently exposed privileged backgrounds generating minority gaps limiting upward mobility without addressing root causes poverty."
