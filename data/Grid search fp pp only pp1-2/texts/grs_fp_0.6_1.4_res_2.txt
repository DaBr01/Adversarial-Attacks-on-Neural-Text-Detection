Terrorism is a global issue that has been on the rise in recent years, with attacks happening in various countries around the world. There are several events and experiences that I believe are contributing to this increase in terrorism.

One major factor that I believe is causing the increase in terrorism is political instability and conflicts in different parts of the world. When governments fail to address issues such as corruption, human rights abuses, or ethnic tensions, it creates an environment where extremist groups can thrive. These groups often recruit disenfranchised individuals who feel marginalized by society and offer them a sense of purpose and belonging through their radical ideologies.

Another event that I believe is fueling the rise of terrorism is religious extremism. Groups like ISIS have used religion as a tool to recruit followers and justify their violent actions. The spread of ultra-conservative interpretations of Islam has also played a role in radicalizing individuals and justifying acts of violence against those who do not adhere to their beliefs.

Social media has also played a significant role in the increase in terrorism. Platforms like Twitter and Facebook allow extremist groups to spread their propaganda quickly and reach a wide audience. They can use these platforms to recruit new members, radicalize vulnerable individuals, and coordinate attacks without being detected by authorities.

Additionally, economic disparities and lack of opportunities for young people are contributing factors to the rise in terrorism. In many parts of the world, especially in developing countries, there are high levels of unemployment among young people which makes them susceptible to recruitment by extremist groups promising them financial support or a better life if they join their cause.

The 9/11 attacks were a turning point for international counterterrorism efforts as well as for terrorist organizations worldwide; Al-Qaeda's ability to carry out such an audacious attack involving multiple actors across borders demonstrated both the capacity for devastation from relatively small numbers compared with traditional armies but also showed greater vulnerability when exposed due--in part because they now knew how powerfully coordinated responses could be built up rapidly after any similar-scaled incident elsewhere happened again

In conclusion, there are several events and experiences that I agree are causing the increase in terrorism. Political instability, religious extremism, social media propaganda, economic disparities, lack of opportunities for young people all play a role in perpetuating this cycle of violence. It is important for governments and communities around the world to address these root causes if we want to effectively combat terrorism and create a safer future for all.
