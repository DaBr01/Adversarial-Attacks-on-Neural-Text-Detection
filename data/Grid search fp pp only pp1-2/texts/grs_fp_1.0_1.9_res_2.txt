There are numerous events and experiences that I believe have contributed to the increase in terrorism around the world. One major factor is social, economic, and political inequality. Many terrorist groups are formed by individuals who feel marginalized or oppressed by their government or society. They may turn to extremism as a way to voice their grievances and take action against perceived injustices.

In many cases, these individuals come from disadvantaged backgrounds with limited access to education, employment opportunities, and social services. Without hope for a better future, they may be susceptible to radical ideologies that promise change through violence. Economic disparities between different regions or countries can also contribute to feelings of resentment and fuel extremist movements.

Political turmoil and instability are another key driver of terrorism. In countries where there is widespread corruption, repression of dissenting voices, or weak governance structures, terrorist groups are more likely to thrive. These conditions create fertile ground for recruiting new members who may see violent extremism as the only means of effecting change in an oppressive regime.

Additionally, foreign interventions and military actions can inadvertently escalate conflicts and give rise to more violent responses from disillusioned populations. The invasion of Iraq in 2003 provides a prime example of how toppling authoritarian regimes without comprehensive plans for post-war stability can lead to power vacuums ripe for exploitation by extremist groups like ISIS.

Technological advancements have also played a role in facilitating radicalization processes through online propaganda campaigns carried out by terrorist organizations on various social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter , Telegram etc.)

Furthermore,the global refugee crisis has exacerbated tensions between host communities and displaced persons seeking safety from conflict zones.This situation has fueled anti-immigrant sentiment which some extremists have exploited
