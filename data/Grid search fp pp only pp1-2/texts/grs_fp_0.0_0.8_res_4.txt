Numerous studies have examined the relationship between preschool attendance and academic achievement in later years. The question of whether children who attend preschool do better in school is a crucial one, as early childhood education continues to be a topic of debate and discussion among educators, policymakers, and parents.

Research consistently shows that children who attend preschool have better academic outcomes than those who do not. A study conducted by the National Institute for Early Education Research (NIEER) found that children who attend preschool are more likely to have higher test scores, better grades, and higher rates of high school graduation compared to their peers who did not attend preschool. These findings suggest that early childhood education provides a strong foundation for future academic success.

One reason why preschool attendance is linked to better academic outcomes is the exposure to early learning experiences that it provides. Preschools offer developmentally appropriate activities that help children develop essential skills such as language, literacy, math, and social-emotional competencies. These early experiences can set the stage for continued academic success by helping children build a strong foundation of knowledge and skills that will benefit them throughout their schooling.

Additionally, preschool attendance has been shown to improve school readiness. Children who attend preschool are more likely to enter kindergarten with the necessary skills and knowledge to succeed academically. Studies have found that preschool attendees have better early literacy and numeracy skills, as well as better social and emotional development, which are all important factors for success in school.

Preschool attendance also has long-term benefits for academic achievement. Research has indicated that children who attend preschool are more likely to develop positive attitudes towards learning and have higher levels of motivation and engagement in school. These factors contribute to better academic performance over time, as children who are motivated and engaged are more likely to persist in their studies and achieve their academic goals.

Furthermore, preschool attendance can have a positive impact on closing the achievement gap. Children from low-income families and other disadvantaged backgrounds often lack the resources and support needed to succeed academically. By providing high-quality early childhood education to these children, preschool can help level the playing field and improve educational outcomes for all students.

In conclusion, research consistently shows that children who attend preschool do better in school. Preschool attendance has been linked to improved academic outcomes, increased school readiness, and long-term benefits for academic achievement. Preschool provides children with essential early learning experiences that set the stage for success in school and in life. As early childhood education continues to be a priority for educators and policymakers, it is clear that preschool attendance plays a crucial role in promoting academic success for all children.
