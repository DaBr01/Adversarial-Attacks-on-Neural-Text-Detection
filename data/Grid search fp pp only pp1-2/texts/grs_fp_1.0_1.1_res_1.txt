In recent years, there has been increasing awareness and advocacy for the inclusion of disabled students in higher education institutions. As a result, the question of whether universities should provide accommodations to disabled students has become a highly debated topic. While some argue that it is the responsibility of universities to create an accessible environment for all students, others believe that providing accommodations may place an undue burden on these institutions.

One compelling argument in favor of providing accommodations to disabled students is rooted in principles of equality and fairness. All individuals have a right to access education and pursue their academic goals regardless of any disabilities they may have. By denying accommodations to disabled students, universities are essentially perpetuating inequality and depriving these individuals of opportunities for success.

Furthermore, failing to provide accommodations can lead to negative outcomes such as lower academic performance, dropout rates, and mental health issues among disabled students. Research has shown that when provided with appropriate support services such as extended time on exams or assistive technology devices, disabled students are able to perform just as well academically as their non-disabled peers. Without such accommodations, however, these individuals may struggle unnecessarily and fail to reach their full potential.

Additionally, it is important for universities to comply with legal mandates regarding disability rights. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires all educational institutions receiving federal funding to provide reasonable accommodations for disabled individuals. Failure to do so not only constitutes a violation of federal law but also reflects poorly on the university’s commitment towards diversity and inclusivity.

On the other hand, some critics argue that providing accommodations may be too costly or impractical for universities with limited resources. They contend that accommodating every type of disability can be challenging due to varying needs and preferences among different individuals. However, proponents counter this argument by noting that many cost-effective solutions exist that can benefit multiple groups simultaneously.
