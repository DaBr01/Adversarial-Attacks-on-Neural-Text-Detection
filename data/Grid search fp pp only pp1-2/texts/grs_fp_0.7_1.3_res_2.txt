Terrorism has been a major issue in the global political landscape for many decades now. While there are various factors that can contribute to the increase in terrorism, there are certain events and experiences that I agree have played a significant role in exacerbating this problem.

One of the key events that I believe is causing an increase in terrorism is the ongoing conflicts and wars in countries such as Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Yemen. These conflicts have created a breeding ground for terrorist groups to thrive and recruit new members. The chaos and instability caused by these wars have allowed extremist ideologies to take root and spread among vulnerable populations who may feel marginalized or disenfranchised.

Another factor that I believe is contributing to the rise in terrorism is the proliferation of social media and online communication platforms. Extremist groups have increasingly turned to these platforms to spread their propaganda, recruit followers, and plan attacks. The ease with which individuals can access extremist content online has made it easier for radical ideologies to be disseminated widely, leading more people down the path towards violent extremism.

Furthermore, I think that the failure of governments and international organizations to address underlying grievances such as poverty, inequality, discrimination, and lack of opportunities is also fueling the rise in terrorism. When individuals feel marginalized or oppressed by their governments or societies, they may be more susceptible to radicalization and recruitment by terrorist groups offering them a sense of purpose or belonging.

Additionally, I believe that foreign interventions by Western powers in countries like Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and Syria have also contributed to an increase in terrorism. These interventions have often led to destabilization and power vacuums that allow extremist groups to gain ground and establish themselves within these regions. Furthermore, civilian casualties resulting from military operations can create resentment among local populations towards Western powers, making them more sympathetic towards terrorist causes.

In conclusion,
While there are many complex factors at play when it comes to understanding what causes terrorism,
I believe that certain events such as ongoing conflicts,
the proliferation of social media,
failure tackling underlying grievances
and foreign interventions all play key roles.
addressing these issues will be essential if we hope
to effectively combat terrorism globally
and prevent further acts.
Ultimately,
it will require coordinated efforts by governments,
international organizations,
civil society groups,
and individuals alike work together
to address these challenges head-on 
if we want see any real progress being made 
in countering this threat effectively
