Terrorism is a complex and multifaceted issue that has plagued global society for decades. While there is no single cause for the increase in terrorism, there are certain events and experiences that have been identified as contributing factors to its rise. In this essay, I will explore some of these events and experiences that I believe are causing the increase in terrorism.

One major event that has been linked to the increase in terrorism is the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. The region has been plagued by violence and instability for many years, with countries such as Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan experiencing widespread warfare and political upheaval. This instability has created fertile ground for terrorist organizations such as ISIS to thrive, as they exploit the chaos and insecurity to recruit new members and carry out attacks.

Additionally, the US-led invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq in the early 2000s have also been cited as contributing factors to the increase in terrorism. These military interventions not only destabilized these countries but also fueled anti-western sentiment and provided a rallying cry for extremist groups. The presence of foreign troops in Muslim-majority countries has often been used by terrorist organizations as a justification for their attacks, further exacerbating the cycle of violence.

Another key experience that is believed to be contributing to the rise in terrorism is social marginalization and alienation. Many individuals who join terrorist groups are often disenfranchised youths who feel marginalized by society or oppressed by oppressive governments. These individuals may be drawn to extremist ideologies that promise them a sense of purpose, belonging, and empowerment that they may not find elsewhere. By addressing issues of social inequality and providing opportunities for marginalized communities, it may be possible to reduce the appeal of terrorist groups.

In recent years, there has also been a sharp rise in online radicalization and recruitment tactics used by terrorist organizations. Social media platforms have made it easier for these groups to spread their propaganda, recruit new members, and coordinate attacks. The anonymity of the internet allows individuals to engage with extremist ideologies without fear of retribution, making it an effective tool for radicalization. Efforts must be made to counter these narratives online and disrupt extremist networks before they can radicalize vulnerable individuals.

In conclusion, there are multiple events and experiences that are contributing to the increase in terrorism around the world. The ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, military interventions by Western powers, social marginalization, and online radicalization all play a role in fueling extremism and violence. Addressing these root causes will require a multifaceted approach that involves political solutions, social reforms, and counterterrorism efforts both online and offline. Only by understanding and addressing these underlying factors can we hope to stem the tide of terrorism in our society.
