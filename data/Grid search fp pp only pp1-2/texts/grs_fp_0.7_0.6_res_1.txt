In recent years, there has been a growing awareness of the importance of providing equal opportunities for individuals with disabilities in all areas of life. This includes access to education, and consequently, universities have come under scrutiny for their treatment of disabled students. 

One key issue that has arisen is whether universities should provide accommodations to disabled students. While some argue that it is the responsibility of institutions to ensure that all students have equal access to learning opportunities, others believe that providing accommodations can be costly and may not always be necessary.

One argument in favor of providing accommodations to disabled students is based on principles of equality and social justice. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities recognizes the right to education for all individuals, including those with disabilities. By failing to provide necessary accommodations, universities are effectively denying these students their basic right to education. Moreover, by excluding disabled students from certain programs or courses due to lack of accommodations, universities are perpetuating inequality and discrimination.

Furthermore, research has shown that providing accommodations can lead to better outcomes for disabled students. A study conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics found that more than half of college graduates with disabilities reported using accommodations during their studies. These accommodations helped them overcome barriers related to mobility challenges, learning disabilities, or sensory impairments and allowed them to successfully complete their degrees.

Providing accommodations also benefits universities themselves by promoting diversity and inclusivity on campus. By creating an environment where all students feel welcome and supported, universities can attract a wider range of talented individuals from different backgrounds and perspectives. This diversity enriches the educational experience for all students and fosters a culture of understanding and inclusion.

On the other hand, some argue against providing accommodations for disabled students citing concerns about cost and feasibility. It is true that implementing certain accommodations can be financially burdensome for universities especially if they need specialized equipment or technology. Additionally, some may argue that making exceptions for disabled students could open up a Pandora's box where everyone requests special treatment leading to chaos in academic settings.

However, these arguments fail to recognize the fundamental rights of individuals with disabilities as well as the long-term benefits associated with providing accommodations in higher education settings. As society continues to progress towards greater inclusivity and equality for all individuals it becomes imperative for universities to adapt their policies and practices accordingly.
