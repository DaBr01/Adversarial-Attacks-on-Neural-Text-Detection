The question of whether children who attend preschool do better in school has been a topic of debate among educators, researchers, and parents for many years. Numerous studies have attempted to determine if there is a correlation between preschool attendance and academic success in later years. While the results are not always consistent, the majority of research suggests that children who attend preschool tend to perform better academically than those who do not.

One study conducted by the National Institute for Early Education Research (NIEER) found that children who attended high-quality preschool programs were more likely to enter kindergarten with stronger pre-reading skills, richer vocabularies, and higher math skills than their peers who did not attend preschool. These advantages continued into their elementary school years, with preschool attendees showing higher levels of reading and math achievement throughout their schooling.

Another study published in the journal Child Development looked at the long-term effects of preschool attendance on academic performance. The study followed over 1,000 children from low-income families who had participated in a Head Start program, a federal preschool program for low-income children. The researchers found that children who had attended Head Start were more likely to graduate from high school, attend college, and earn higher salaries than those who had not attended preschool.

Furthermore, research has shown that attending preschool can have positive effects on social and emotional development. A study published in the Journal of Educational Psychology found that children who attended preschool were more likely to exhibit pro-social behaviors, such as sharing and cooperating with others, than those who did not attend preschool. This suggests that preschool can help children develop important social skills that will benefit them both academically and socially throughout their lives.

Despite the growing body of evidence supporting the benefits of preschool attendance, there are still some skeptics who argue that the effects of preschool may be overstated. They point to studies that show the benefits of preschool fade over time or that other factors, such as parental involvement or socioeconomic status, play a larger role in determining academic success.

While it is true that factors outside of preschool attendance can influence a child's academic performance, the weight of evidence suggests that attending preschool can provide children with a valuable foundation for future success. High-quality preschool programs offer opportunities for young children to develop essential cognitive, social, and emotional skills in a structured and supportive environment. These skills can help children succeed academically and adapt to the demands of formal education.

Overall, the research indicates that children who attend preschool are more likely to do better in school than those who do not. While preschool is not a guarantee of academic success, it can provide children with important advantages that set them on a path toward future achievement. By investing in early childhood education, we can give all children the opportunity to reach their full potential in school and beyond.
