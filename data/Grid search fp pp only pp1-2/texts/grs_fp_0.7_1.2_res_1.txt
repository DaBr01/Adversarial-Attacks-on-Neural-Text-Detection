In recent years, there has been a growing awareness of the importance of providing accommodations to disabled students in higher education settings. The question of whether universities should do so is a complex and multi-faceted issue that requires careful consideration.

One argument in favor of providing accommodations to disabled students is that it promotes inclusivity and diversity on college campuses. By ensuring that all students have equal access to educational opportunities, universities can create a more welcoming and supportive environment for individuals with disabilities. This can lead to increased participation and engagement among disabled students, ultimately benefiting both the individuals themselves and the broader university community.

Additionally, providing accommodations to disabled students is not only a matter of social justice and equity but also a legal requirement. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and other anti-discrimination laws, colleges and universities are required to provide reasonable accommodations to qualified individuals with disabilities in order to ensure equal access to educational programs and activities. Failure to do so could result in potential legal action against the institution.

Another reason why universities should provide accommodations to disabled students is that doing so can help improve academic outcomes for these individuals. Research has shown that when appropriate accommodations are provided, disabled students are better able to participate fully in their classes, complete assignments, and perform well on exams. By removing barriers to learning, universities can help maximize the potential of disabled students and promote their academic success.

Moreover, providing accommodations can also have long-term benefits for disabled students beyond their time in college. By acquiring essential skills like time management, organization, self-advocacy, and problem-solving through the accommodation process, these individuals are better equipped to navigate challenges they may face after graduation in navigating employment opportunities or pursuing further education.

On the other hand, some may argue that providing accommodations puts an undue financial burden on universities at a time when many institutions are already struggling with budget constraints. However it is important for colleges and universities to prioritize the needs of all their students – including those with disabilities –in order truly foster an inclusive campus community that values diversity.
