In today's digital age, technology and gadgets have become an integral part of our daily lives. Children are growing up surrounded by smartphones, tablets, laptops, and other electronic devices that provide access to endless sources of information and entertainment. While these advancements have undoubtedly revolutionized the way we live and learn, there is a growing concern about how excessive use of technology may impact children's studies.

One way in which technology affects children's studies is through distraction. With constant notifications from social media platforms, video games, or messaging apps popping up on their screens, children can easily get distracted from their schoolwork. Studies have shown that multitasking while studying can lead to poor academic performance as it hinders cognitive processes such as memory retention and concentration. Additionally, spending hours on gadgets can also lead to physical health problems such as eye strain or disrupted sleep patterns.

On the other hand, technology can also be a powerful tool for enhancing learning outcomes. Educational apps and online resources offer interactive and engaging ways for children to explore new concepts and subjects outside the traditional classroom setting. These tools can help students develop critical thinking skills, improve literacy rates among young learners with dyslexia or reading difficulties.
