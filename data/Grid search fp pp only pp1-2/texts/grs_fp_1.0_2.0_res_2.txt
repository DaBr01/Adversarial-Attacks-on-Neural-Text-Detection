Terrorism is a complex and multifaceted issue that poses significant challenges to global security. While there are many factors contributing to the increase in terrorism globally, events and experiences play a crucial role in fostering radicalization and promoting violent extremism.

One key factor leading to the rise in terrorism is the prevalence of social, economic, and political grievances among marginalized populations. Many individuals who engage in terrorist activities come from disadvantaged backgrounds with limited opportunities for education, employment, and social mobility. These individuals may feel disenfranchised by their governments or societies, leading them to seek alternative means of expressing their frustrations through violence.

Events such as discriminatory policies, systemic inequalities, and perceived injustices can further fuel feelings of resentment and alienation among vulnerable communities. For example, the War on Terror launched by Western powers following the 9/11 attacks has resulted in widespread civilian casualties across Muslim-majority countries like Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen which have fueled anti-Western sentiment and provided recruitment fodder for extremist groups like ISIS or Al-Qaeda.

Moreover increasing instances of xenophobia,intolerance,and discrimination against minority populations especially Muslims can contribute towards feelings of exclusion,fear,& anger resulting into joining terrorist organizations.This was evidenced during Christchurch mosque shooting where white supremacist Brenton Tarrant carried out mass killings sparking anger & retribution globally amongst Muslim community paving way for linkage between these isolated incidents n occurrence f terror attacks .
