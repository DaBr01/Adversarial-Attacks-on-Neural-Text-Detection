Preschool education has long been a topic of interest among educators, parents, and policymakers. The question of whether children who attend preschool perform better in school than those who do not has been the subject of numerous studies and debates. While some argue that preschool can provide important foundational skills for academic success, others contend that its effects are limited or even detrimental to children's overall development.

One of the key arguments in favor of preschool attendance is that it provides children with a structured learning environment at an early age. Preschools typically focus on developing basic cognitive, social, emotional, and motor skills through play-based activities and interactions with peers. These experiences can help children build the foundation for later academic success by fostering curiosity, creativity, problem-solving abilities, and communication skills.

Research has shown that children who attend high-quality preschool programs are more likely to enter kindergarten ready to learn compared to their peers who did not attend preschool. They tend to have stronger language and math skills, as well as better self-regulation abilities such as impulse control and attention span. These advantages can translate into improved academic performance throughout elementary school and beyond.

Furthermore, studies have demonstrated that attending preschool can lead to higher rates of high school graduation and college enrollment. Children who have participated in quality early childhood education programs are more likely to develop positive attitudes towards learning, higher levels of motivation to succeed academically, and greater confidence in their own abilities.

On the other hand, critics of mandatory preschool education argue that its benefits may be overstated or short-lived. Some suggest that any initial gains made by attending preschool may fade over time as students progress through their schooling years due to various factors such as lackluster teaching methods in subsequent grades or increased stress from academic pressures.

Moreover,
social-emotional development might suffer when young children are exposed prematurely
to formal educational settings instead focusing on free-play experiences.
While research suggests some initial improvements resulting from participation
in early childhood care (ECC) programmes indetifying sustained outcomes remians stumbed down.
