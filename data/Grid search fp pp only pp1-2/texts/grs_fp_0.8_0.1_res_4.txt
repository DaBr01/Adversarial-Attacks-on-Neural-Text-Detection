Preschool education has been a contentious topic in the field of education for many years. Some argue that preschool provides children with a strong foundation for their academic and social development, while others believe that it has little to no impact on a child's success in school. Despite the ongoing debate, research studies have consistently shown that children who attend preschool tend to do better in school compared to those who do not.

One of the primary reasons why preschool attendance is associated with improved academic performance is that it provides children with early exposure to basic concepts and skills. Preschool curriculum typically focuses on teaching children fundamental concepts such as letters, numbers, shapes, colors, and basic math and language skills. By introducing these concepts at an early age, preschool helps children develop a strong foundation for their future learning.

In addition to academic preparation, preschool also plays a crucial role in developing important social and emotional skills in children. Preschool environments are designed to promote social interaction, collaboration, communication, and empathy among young learners. These experiences help children develop essential social skills that are vital for their success in school and beyond.

Research studies have consistently shown that children who attend preschool exhibit higher levels of school readiness compared to those who do not. School readiness refers to a child's ability to demonstrate key skills such as following directions, listening attentively, working independently or as part of a group, problem-solving effectively, and managing emotions appropriately – all of which are essential for successful learning outcomes.

Furthermore, longitudinal studies have demonstrated that the benefits of attending preschool extend beyond the early grades. Children who attended high-quality preschool programs are more likely to graduate from high school compared to their peers who did not attend preschool. Additionally, they are also more likely to pursue higher education or vocational training after high school.

Moreover,, research studies have also shown that the benefits of attending preschool extend beyond academic outcomes; they can also have positive effects on mental health outcomes later in life., Studies have demonstrated that individuals who attended quality early childhood programs were less likely report symptoms related mental illnesses such depression or anxiety later in life., This suggests attending quality early childhood programs could play an important role promoting resilience psychological wellbeing throughout an individual’s developmental trajectory (1).
