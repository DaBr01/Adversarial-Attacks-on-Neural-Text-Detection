In today's modern world, technology and gadgets have become an integral part of our daily lives. With the advancement in technology, children are exposed to various devices such as smartphones, tablets, laptops, and gaming consoles at a very young age. While these devices can be beneficial for educational purposes and entertainment, there is growing concern about how excessive use of technology can affect the studies of children.

One major way that technology and gadgets affect the studies of children is through distractions. Children often find it difficult to concentrate on their schoolwork when they have access to devices that offer endless entertainment options like games, social media platforms, or streaming services. This constant distraction can lead to poor academic performance as children struggle to focus on their assignments or homework.

Moreover, spending too much time on screens has been shown to impact brain development in children. Excessive screen time can hinder cognitive abilities such as memory retention and critical thinking skills. Additionally, prolonged exposure to blue light emitted from screens can disrupt sleep patterns which are essential for learning and overall well-being.

Furthermore, the use of technology and gadgets can also contribute to a sedentary lifestyle among children. Instead of engaging in physical activities like playing outside or participating in sports, many children prefer sitting indoors while using electronic devices. This lack of physical activity not only affects their physical health but also impacts their mental health by increasing stress levels and decreasing motivation.

Another important aspect to consider is the potential negative effects of social media on students' studies.It's no secret that social media platforms play a significant role in teenagers' lives - influencing everything from communication with peers,to self-image,and even academic performance.Research shows that heavy use of social media negatively impacts studentsâ€™ grades,making them more likely o obtain lower GPAs than those who spend less time online.The constant need for validation from others.or fear f missing out (FOMO),associated with socail netwarking sites,affects concentration nd information retention -key components n successful studying.Furthermore,the addictive nature f scrolllinghrough news feedsor liking postsca preductablyeats up-time.Other risks f requent socal meia usaqgeinduce pnline bullying oc behaviors,such ass harrasment,intimidation,cyberatlkng,damging studentsoemotionalwelbeing-and evnn-reultinguicidal behavesors.A clearl associationbetwen addresdsand negativperformance records-important aspectsaffectinchnilderneducational pathways....:data frimthe Olflord private schools(odelof superiority)revals- tatstudents residing95%ofstudy tomeonsmbartphonesgradually scorebweron tests.and earn loqrer,GPAsthan studnts ith limited techattention-.This issue raiers seious alrms=sregarding hindern victories getaindth next generation
