In recent years, terrorism has become a major global concern, with attacks occurring frequently in various countries around the world. While there are many factors that contribute to the increase in terrorism, events and experiences have played a significant role in fueling this trend.

One of the main events that have contributed to the rise of terrorism is the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. The region has been plagued by violence and instability for decades, with various militant groups such as ISIS taking advantage of the chaos to carry out terrorist attacks. The civil war in Syria, for example, has created a power vacuum that extremist groups have exploited to establish their presence and recruit new members. This ongoing conflict has not only radicalized individuals within these regions but also inspired sympathizers globally to carry out acts of terror.

Furthermore, experiences of discrimination and marginalization have also contributed to the increase in terrorism. Many individuals who feel marginalized or oppressed due to their race, religion, or ethnicity may be more susceptible to radicalization and being drawn into extremist organizations. For example, young Muslims living in Western countries may face discrimination and prejudice, leading them to feel isolated from mainstream society and vulnerable to extremist ideologies that offer them a sense of belonging and purpose. This sense of alienation can push individuals towards violent extremism as a way to express their anger and frustration.

Another factor contributing to increased terrorism is social media's influence on recruitment and radicalization. Platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube have allowed terrorist organizations to reach audiences worldwide easily. They use these platforms not only for propaganda but also for recruiting new members and spreading hate-filled ideologies. Individuals are exposed to a constant barrage of extremist content online, making it easier for them to become indoctrinated and motivated to carry out acts of terror.

In addition to these events and experiences, geopolitical factors also play a significant role in fueling terrorism. Foreign interventions by powerful nations can create resentment among local populations, leading some individuals to turn towards violent extremism as a means of resisting perceived oppression or occupation. Instances such as the US invasion of Iraq in 2003 or Russia's intervention in Ukraine have led to increased anti-Western sentiments among certain groups which can manifest into acts of terrorism targeting Western interests.
