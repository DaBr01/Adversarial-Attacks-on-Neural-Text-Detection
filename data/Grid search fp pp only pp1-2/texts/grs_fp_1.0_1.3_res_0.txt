Violent cartoons have been a subject of debate for many years, as they have the potential to influence children's behavior and attitudes. While some believe that exposure to violent cartoons can lead to aggression and desensitization in children, others argue that there is no direct link between watching violent cartoons and negative outcomes. This essay will explore the effects of violent cartoons on children by examining various studies and research findings.

One of the most commonly cited concerns about violent cartoons is that they can increase aggressive behavior in children. A study conducted by Anderson et al. (2007) found that prolonged exposure to violence in media, including cartoons, was associated with increased levels of aggression in both short-term and long-term settings. The researchers concluded that repeated exposure to violence can desensitize children to it, leading them to be more accepting of aggressive behaviors in real-life situations.

Moreover, another study by Bushman & Huesmann (2014) confirmed these findings by showing a strong correlation between watching violent television programs as a child and committing aggressive acts later in life. The researchers suggested that constant exposure to violence through media could shape cognitive schemas related to aggressiveness, making it more likely for individuals who watch such content regularly to exhibit hostile behaviors themselves.

In addition to fostering aggression, violent cartoons may also contribute to desensitization among young viewers. Desensitization refers to the process whereby individuals become less sensitive or empathetic towards real-life violence after being exposed repeatedly through various forms of media. Accordingto Funk (1993), continuous exposure  to graphic violence might dull emotional responses towards seeing harm inflicted onto others.Comic book artist Rik Kirby declared: "Children who spend time viewing images where people are murdered become indifferent."

On the other hand,some experts argue against this view claiming that not allchildrenwho watchviolentcartoons endupbehavingviolently.In their research,Gunter & Gunter(2002)demonstratedthatonlythosekidswhowerealready predisposedtowardsaggressionmightbecomesusceptibletocartoon-inducedviolence.Othersfindingsupportingthisviewinclude agroundbreakingstudyconductedby Ferguson& Kilburn(2009), which revealed no significantevidenceofacorrelationbetweenwatchingviolenttelevisionprogramsandreal-worldaggressivedeedsinthelongrun.Thisstudystronglychallengesprevailingnotionsthatcastallviolentmediainnegative light.
