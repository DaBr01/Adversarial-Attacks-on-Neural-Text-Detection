Terrorism is a global issue that has been on the rise in recent years, with attacks occurring more frequently and in various parts of the world. There are several events and experiences that have contributed to this increase in terrorism, some of which I agree are significant factors.

One major event that has fueled the increase in terrorism is the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, particularly in countries like Syria and Iraq. The war-torn region has created a breeding ground for radical groups such as ISIS to thrive and recruit new members. The violence and chaos present in these countries have pushed many individuals towards extremist ideologies as they seek revenge or justice for perceived injustices against their people.

Another event that has played a role in increasing terrorism is social exclusion and discrimination faced by certain minority groups. Many terrorist organizations target vulnerable individuals who feel marginalized by society due to their race, religion, or social status. These individuals may be drawn to extremist beliefs as a way to gain power or seek retribution against those they perceive as oppressors.

In addition, globalization has also contributed to the increase in terrorism by allowing extremist ideologies to spread across borders at an unprecedented rate. With advances in technology and communication, terrorist organizations can now easily recruit followers from different parts of the world and carry out coordinated attacks on an international scale.

Furthermore, economic instability and poverty have been identified as underlying factors that contribute to acts of terror. When individuals lack access to basic necessities such as food, shelter, education, or employment opportunities, they may become desperate and susceptible to recruitment by terrorist groups promising financial support or rewards for participating in violent activities.

Political grievances are also a significant driver of terrorism worldwide. In many cases, individuals join terrorist organizations because they feel disenfranchised or oppressed by their government's policies or actions. This sense of injustice can lead them to turn towards violence as a means of addressing their grievances.

Lastly but not least important factor contributing towards increased terrorism is religious extremism propagated through interpretations tending toward intolerance among followers which escalate into reactionary endeavours including committing extreme measures like 'jihad'.

In conclusion,the rise of terrorism is complex phenomenon influenced by multiple interconnected aspects around globe.To effectively address issues surrounding it; governments,society,and institutions need collaboratively tackle root causes behind spread.The events & experiences aforementioned indeed provokes insightful reflections,such diverse motives paves paths enabling understanding problematic connections essential mitigate rises consequences posed forms case study millennium challenge confronting humanity today.Its imperative alternative better path focuses common interests peaceful solutions making progress counter negative effects emanated amplified towards harmonious coexistence amongst varying demographic constituents ECB2FA0063F4''.
