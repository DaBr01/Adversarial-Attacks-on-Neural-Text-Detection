Terrorism has become a global threat in recent decades, with devastating attacks occurring in various parts of the world. In order to address this issue effectively, it is essential to identify and understand the root causes of terrorism. While there are multiple factors that contribute to the rise of terrorism, some events and experiences stand out as significant drivers for this phenomenon.

One major factor contributing to the increase in terrorism is political instability and conflict in different regions. When countries experience political unrest, civil wars, or oppressive governments, it creates a breeding ground for extremist ideologies to thrive. Terrorist groups capitalize on these situations by recruiting disaffected individuals who feel marginalized or disenfranchised by their governments. The lack of stable governance and security forces allows these groups to operate with impunity and carry out attacks against civilians.

In addition, social and economic marginalization also play a crucial role in fueling terrorist activities. Many terrorists come from impoverished backgrounds where they lack opportunities for education, employment, or social mobility. They may feel alienated from mainstream society and turn to extremist groups that promise them a sense of belonging and purpose. Economic inequalities can create fertile ground for radicalization, as people who feel marginalized may be more susceptible to joining terrorist organizations.

Moreover, the spread of extremist propaganda through online platforms has further exacerbated the problem of terrorism. Social media enables terrorist groups to reach a wider audience and disseminate their ideologies easily. Propaganda videos, recruitment messages, and incitement to violence can all be shared online, leading vulnerable individuals to be radicalized without direct physical contact with terrorist networks.

Furthermore, geopolitical conflicts and interventions by foreign powers have also contributed to the rise of terrorism in many regions. Military interventions in countries such as Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria have led to power vacuums that were exploited by terrorist organizations like ISIS and Al-Qaeda. These groups used these conflicts to recruit fighters, acquire weapons, and expand their influence across borders. Additionally, drone strikes and other forms of targeted killings carried out by Western countries have often resulted in civilian casualties, which can fuel resentment and drive ordinary citizens towards extremism.

In conclusion, there are several events and experiences that I agree are causing the increase in terrorism worldwide. Political instability, social marginalization, online propaganda, and foreign interventions all play a crucial role in fostering extremism and radicalization among vulnerable populations. Addressing these root causes requires coordinated efforts from governments, international organizations, civil society groups, and individuals to tackle terrorism effectively. By addressing these underlying issues comprehensively, we can hope to reduce the prevalence of terrorism and promote peace and security globally.
