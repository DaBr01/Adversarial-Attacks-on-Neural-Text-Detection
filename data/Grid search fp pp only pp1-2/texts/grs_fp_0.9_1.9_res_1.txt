Many universities around the world have made strides in improving accessibility for disabled students by providing accommodations such as ramps, elevators, and designated parking spots. However, there is still a debate on whether or not universities should provide additional accommodations to meet the needs of all disabled students.

On one hand, some argue that it is the responsibility of universities to ensure that all students have equal access to education. By providing accommodations such as note-taking services, extended exam times, and sign language interpreters, universities can create an inclusive environment where disabled students can thrive academically. These accommodations are essential for ensuring that all students have the opportunity to succeed in higher education.

Additionally, providing accommodations for disabled students aligns with laws and regulations put in place to protect individuals with disabilities. In many countries, including the United States with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Canada's Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA), institutions are required by law to provide reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities. Failing to do so could result in legal repercussions and discrimination lawsuits.

Furthermore, offering accommodations benefits not only disabled students but also benefits the university community as a whole. When colleges prioritize accessibility and inclusion, they demonstrate their commitment to diversity and equity. This sends a powerful message about valuing every individual regardless of their abilities or limitations.

However others argue against this stance saying that accommodation constitutes special treatment which provides unfair advantages over non-disabled peers who may be competing for limited resources like scholarships or job opportunities after graduation. They claim that these extra supports give disabled studentâ€™s preferential treatment just because they require it due solely based on being part of a group protected under disability legislation while ignoring other factors affecting academic performance
