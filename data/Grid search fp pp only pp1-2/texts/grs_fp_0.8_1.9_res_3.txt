In today's digital age, technology and gadgets have become an integral part of our lives, including the lives of children. With the increasing availability and affordability of smartphones, tablets, laptops, and other electronic devices, children are constantly exposed to screens and various forms of technology. While these advancements have brought numerous benefits in terms of learning opportunities and connectivity, they also pose several challenges when it comes to their impact on children's studies.

One way in which technology and gadgets affect the studies of children is through distractions. The constant notifications from social media apps, video games, and streaming platforms can easily divert a child's attention away from their schoolwork. This can lead to decreased focus and productivity during study sessions or homework time. Furthermore, excessive screen time has been linked to issues such as eye strain, headaches, fatigue, sleep disturbances which may hinder a child's ability to concentrate on their academic tasks.

Moreover, technology can also contribute to limited physical activity among children. Spending long hours sitting in front of screens not only affects their overall health but also detracts them from engaging in outdoor activities that promote both physical fitness and mental well-being. Lack of exercise due to prolonged gadget use can result in obesity , weak muscles,and even affect cognitive functions leading ultimately poor performance at school.
