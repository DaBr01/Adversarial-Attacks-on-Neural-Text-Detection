Terrorism is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that has been on the rise in recent years. There are many events and experiences that experts believe are contributing to this increase. In this essay, I will discuss some of these factors and explain why I agree with their assessment.

One major factor that is believed to be contributing to the increase in terrorism is the proliferation of extremist ideologies. With the rise of social media and other online platforms, it has become easier for extremist groups to spread their message and recruit new members. These groups often prey on individuals who feel marginalized or disenfranchised, offering them a sense of belonging and purpose through violence.

I agree with this assessment because we have seen firsthand how extremist ideologies can radicalize individuals and inspire acts of terror. The recent attacks carried out by lone wolves inspired by groups like ISIS serve as a stark reminder of the power these ideologies can have over vulnerable individuals.

Another factor that is often cited as a cause of terrorism is political instability and conflict. When governments are weak or corrupt, it creates an environment ripe for terrorist groups to thrive. Additionally, when there is ongoing conflict between different ethnic or religious groups, it can be used as a recruiting tool by extremists looking to stir up hatred and violence.

I agree with this assessment because we have seen how conflicts in countries like Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Nigeria have provided fertile ground for terrorist organizations like ISIS, Al-Qaeda, Boko Haram, and others to establish themselves and carry out attacks both locally and internationally.

A lack of economic opportunity is also believed to be a contributing factor to the increase in terrorism. When people feel hopeless about their future prospects or struggle to provide for themselves or their families, they may turn to extremism as a way out of poverty. This can be particularly true for young people who see few options for advancement in their communities.

I agree with this assessment because we know that terrorists come from all walks of life but are often drawn from communities facing economic hardship or unemployment. Addressing issues related to economic inequality and promoting opportunities for education and employment can help prevent individuals from being lured into violent extremism.

In conclusion, there are many events and experiences that experts believe are causing the increase in terrorism today. Factors such as extremist ideologies, political instability, conflict, economic disparity all play a role in creating an environment where terrorist groups can thrive. By addressing these root causes through diplomacy, development aid programs,and community engagement we can work towards reducing the appeal of extremism at its source.
