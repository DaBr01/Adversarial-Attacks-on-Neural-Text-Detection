Universities have a duty to provide accommodations to disabled students in order to ensure equal access and opportunities for all individuals pursuing higher education. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 mandates that educational institutions must make reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities, including those attending universities. This legislation was put in place to protect the rights of individuals with disabilities and prevent discrimination based on their physical or mental limitations.

One argument in favor of universities providing accommodations is the moral imperative to create an inclusive and supportive environment for all students. Education is a fundamental human right, and by denying necessary accommodations to disabled students, universities are perpetuating inequality and hindering their ability to fully participate in academic life. Providing ramps, elevators, assistive technology, note-takers, extra time on exams, or other forms of support can empower disabled students to succeed academically and contribute meaningfully to society.

Additionally, offering these accommodations not only benefits individual disabled students but also enriches the overall campus community by promoting diversity and fostering understanding among peers. By creating an accessible campus environment that welcomes all individuals regardless of their abilities or disabilities, universities can cultivate a culture of tolerance and acceptance that values the contributions each student brings.

Moreover, providing accommodations for disabled students aligns with best practices in education research that emphasize Universal Design for Learning (UDL). UDL is a framework used by educators to design instructional materials and activities that meet the needs of diverse learners. By implementing UDL principles across different aspects of university life – from course syllabi to campus facilities – colleges can create environments where every student has equitable opportunities to learn at their own pace using varied approaches.

On the contrary side would be concerns about cost implications associated with providing accommodations for disabled students at universities. Some may argue that funding should be allocated towards improving general infrastructure rather than catering specifically towards a minority group of people who require additional support services due do disability.
Critics might suggest potential abuse or misuse olike f resources allotted toward provisioning accommodation services as some claim instances when able-bodied candidates attempt taking undue advantage through subverting exam rules like securing additional time-to-table responses without legitimate grounds/claims - jeopardizing system integrity
