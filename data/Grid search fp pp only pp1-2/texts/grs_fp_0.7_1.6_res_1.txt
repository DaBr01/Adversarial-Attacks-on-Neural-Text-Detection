In recent years, the issue of providing accommodations to disabled students in higher education institutions has gained more attention. Many advocates argue that universities have a responsibility to ensure that all students, regardless of their disabilities, have equal access to education. On the other hand, some critics question whether universities should be burdened with providing and funding these accommodations. This essay will explore both sides of this debate and make a case for why universities should provide accommodations to disabled students.

Firstly, it is important for universities to provide accommodations to disabled students in order to comply with disability rights laws and promote inclusivity. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) mandates that colleges and universities must provide reasonable accommodations to qualified individuals with disabilities so they can participate fully in educational programs. Denying disabled students these accommodations not only violates federal law but also perpetuates discrimination against them.

Furthermore, by providing accommodations such as modified teaching materials or assistive technologies, universities create an inclusive learning environment where all students can thrive. When disabled students are given the tools and support they need to succeed academically, they are more likely to stay enrolled in school and achieve their academic goals. This not only benefits the individual student but also contributes positively to the overall diversity and success of the university community.

Additionally, providing accommodations can help level the playing field for disabled students who may face unique challenges compared to their non-disabled peers. For example, a student with dyslexia may require extra time on exams or access to audio textbooks in order to effectively engage with course material. By providing these accommodations, universities can ensure that every student has an equitable opportunity to learn and demonstrate their knowledge.

On the other side of the argument, some critics contend that providing accommodations for disabled students places an undue financial burden on universities. They argue that accommodating every disability request could strain already limited resources and potentially detract from other important initiatives or services within the institution.

However, research shows that investing in accessibility measures actually benefits universities in numerous ways. A study conducted by the National Center for College Students with Disabilities found that colleges which prioritize disability services experience higher retention rates among disabled students and improved overall campus climate for diversity and inclusion.
