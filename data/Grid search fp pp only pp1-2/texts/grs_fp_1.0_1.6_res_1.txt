In recent years, there has been an increased focus on ensuring equal access to education for all individuals, including those with disabilities. One of the key ways that universities can support disabled students is by providing accommodations to help them succeed academically. This raises the question: should universities provide accommodations to disabled students? In this essay, I will argue that yes, universities should indeed provide such accommodations.

First and foremost, it is important to recognize that under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), universities are legally required to provide reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities. This means making changes or adjustments so that individuals with disabilities have an equal opportunity to participate in university programs and activities. Failure to do so could result in discrimination lawsuits against the university.

Furthermore, providing accommodations to disabled students is not only a legal obligation but also a moral imperative. All individuals deserve the opportunity to pursue their educational goals regardless of any physical or mental limitations they may face. By offering accommodations such as extended time on exams, note-taking services, accessible classrooms and materials, universities are promoting inclusivity and fostering a supportive learning environment for all students.

Moreover, research has shown that when disabled students receive appropriate accommodations from their university, they perform better academically and are more likely to persist and complete their degree programs. A study conducted by The National Center for Education Statistics found that 86% of college graduates with disabilities reported using academic support services while in school. Providing these necessary resources can significantly enhance the educational experience for disabled students and increase their chances of success.

Another reason why universities should provide accommodations to disabled students is because doing so benefits the entire campus community. By creating an inclusive environment where all individuals feel supported and valued, universities foster diversity and promote understanding among different groups of people. This not only enriches the overall college experience but also prepares all students – both able-bodied and disabled – for life beyond academia in a diverse society.

Critics may argue that providing accommodations for disabled students requires additional financial investment from universities which could strain already limited budgets. However,, investing in accessibility measures ultimately pays off as it enhances recruitment efforts by attracting a wider pool of talented applicants who might otherwise be deterred due lack accommodating facilities at other institutions.. Additionally,making campuses fully accessible often helps avoid costly litigation expenses associated with ADA compliance violations
