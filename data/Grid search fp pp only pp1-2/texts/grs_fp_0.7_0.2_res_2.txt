Terrorism is a global phenomenon that has been on the rise in recent years. While there are many factors that contribute to the increase in terrorist activities, events and experiences play a significant role in shaping individuals' beliefs and motivations to participate in such violent acts. In this essay, I will discuss some of the key events and experiences that I believe are causing the increase in terrorism.

One of the main events that have contributed to the rise of terrorism is social injustice and discrimination. Many individuals who engage in terrorist activities come from marginalized communities where they face systemic discrimination and oppression. These experiences of injustice can fuel feelings of resentment, anger, and hopelessness, leading some individuals to turn to extremist ideologies as a way to seek revenge or take control of their lives. Studies have shown that individuals who perceive themselves as victims of discrimination are more likely to engage in violent extremism as a means of asserting power and agency.

Another event that has played a significant role in increasing terrorism is geopolitical conflicts and military interventions. The invasion of countries like Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, and Libya by Western powers has resulted in destabilization, displacement, violence, and radicalization within these regions. The presence of foreign troops on their soil can be perceived as an act of aggression against local populations, leading to resentment and anti-Western sentiments among some individuals. Furthermore, military interventions often result in civilian casualties, which can further fuel grievances against Western powers and motivate individuals to join terrorist groups.

The rise of social media has also played a key role in increasing terrorism by providing a platform for terrorist organizations to spread propaganda, recruit members, coordinate attacks, and amplify their message globally. Social media platforms allow extremist groups to reach out to vulnerable individuals who may be susceptible to their ideology due to feelings of alienation or disenfranchisement from mainstream society. The echo chambers created by algorithms on these platforms further radicalize users by exposing them only to information that reinforces their existing beliefs.

In addition to these factors, economic deprivation plays a significant role in driving individuals towards terrorism as they may feel marginalized or excluded from society due to poverty or lack of opportunities for socio-economic mobility. This sense of hopelessness can push some individuals towards extremist ideologies as they see violence as a means of achieving change or gaining power.

In conclusion, events such as social injustice and discrimination; geopolitical conflicts; the rise of social media; and economic deprivation are all contributing factors causing an increase in terrorism worldwide. It is essential for policymakers and civil society actors alike to address these root causes through inclusive policies that promote social justice; diplomacy over military intervention; counter-narratives against extremist propaganda; economic development programs; education opportunities for marginalized communities; rehabilitation programs for former extremists; mental health services for trauma survivors among others so we can effectively combat this growing threat.
