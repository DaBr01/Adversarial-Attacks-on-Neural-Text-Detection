Events and experiences are significant factors that contribute to the rise in terrorism worldwide. As a complex phenomenon with multiple contributing factors, understanding the root causes of terrorism is essential in developing effective strategies to combat this growing threat. In this research essay, I will explore several events and experiences that I believe are fueling the increase in terrorism.

One major event that has been widely acknowledged as a catalyst for terrorist activities is the invasion of Iraq by the United States and its allies in 2003. The controversial decision to remove Saddam Hussein from power destabilized the country and created power vacuums that were quickly filled by various militant groups, including Al-Qaeda in Iraq and later ISIS. These terrorist organizations capitalized on sectarian tensions between Sunni and Shia Muslims, leading to widespread violence and chaos across the region. The subsequent years of conflict have bred resentment towards Western powers and fueled anti-American sentiments among extremist groups, making Iraq a breeding ground for terrorism.

Another significant factor driving the increase in terrorism is social and economic marginalization experienced by certain communities around the world. Many terrorists come from disadvantaged backgrounds where poverty, unemployment, and lack of education create fertile ground for radicalization. These individuals may feel marginalized or discriminated against based on their ethnicity, religion, or socio-economic status, leading them to seek solace in extremist ideologies that promise a sense of empowerment and belonging. This sense of alienation can be further exacerbated by discriminatory policies or actions taken by governments, which only serve to deepen divisions within society.

The rise of social media has also played a crucial role in spreading radical ideologies and recruiting new members into terrorist organizations. Platforms like Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and Telegram provide an easy way for extremists to connect with like-minded individuals around the globe, share propaganda videos depicting acts of violence, or recruit followers through online indoctrination campaigns. The anonymity afforded by these platforms allows extremists to operate covertly without fear of being identified or apprehended by authorities until it is too late.

Moreover, geopolitical conflicts such as ongoing wars in Syria, Afghanistan, Yemen, Nigeria have created breeding grounds for terrorist organizations seeking to exploit power vacuums created by civil unrest or political instability. These conflicts often result in widespread destructions of infrastructure vital for economic development such as schools hospitals transportation systems preventing people from accessing basic necessities Imposing harsh living conditions on citizens who then become disgruntled turn frustrated engage themselves into rebellion against those they perceived as responsible .
