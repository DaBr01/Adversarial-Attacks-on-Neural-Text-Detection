Events and experiences that are believed to be causing the increase in terrorism can vary depending on one's perspective and beliefs. However, there are some common factors that many experts agree contribute to the rise of terrorist activities around the world. These include political instability, social inequality, religious extremism, and foreign interventions.

One of the main reasons cited for the increase in terrorism is political instability. In many parts of the world, there are ongoing conflicts between governments and rebel groups or marginalized communities. These conflicts often create an environment where extremist organizations can thrive by exploiting people's grievances and drawing recruits from vulnerable populations. The lack of effective governance also allows terrorist groups to operate with impunity and gain popular support among disenfranchised individuals.

Social inequality is another factor that is believed to contribute to terrorism. When people feel marginalized or discriminated against based on their ethnicity, religion, or socio-economic status, they may be more susceptible to radicalization and being recruited by extremist organizations. Poverty and lack of access to education can also make individuals more vulnerable to being influenced by extremist ideologies as they may see terrorism as a way out of their challenging circumstances.

Religious extremism is often seen as a significant driver behind acts of terrorism. Some religious extremists believe in using violence as a means to achieve their ideological goals or impose their version of religious beliefs on others. This extreme interpretation of religion can lead individuals or groups to commit acts of terror in pursuit of their perceived higher purpose.

Foreign interventions have also been identified as a contributing factor to an increase in terrorism. When foreign powers intervene militarily in countries without considering local dynamics or understanding cultural sensitivities, it can exacerbate existing tensions and fuel anti-western sentiments among local populations. This backlash against foreign interventions has led some groups to resort to violent means such as terrorist attacks on targeted nations' soil.
