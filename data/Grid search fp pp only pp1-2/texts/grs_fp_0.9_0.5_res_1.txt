In recent years, there has been a growing conversation surrounding the provision of accommodations for disabled students in universities. While some argue that these accommodations are essential to ensuring equal access to education, others believe that providing special treatment to certain students creates an unfair advantage. This essay will argue that universities should provide accommodations to disabled students in order to promote inclusivity and ensure equal opportunities for all.

Firstly, it is important to recognize that disabled students face unique challenges when pursuing higher education. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, approximately 11% of undergraduates report having a disability. These disabilities can range from physical impairments such as mobility issues or chronic illnesses, to cognitive or learning disorders like dyslexia or ADHD. Without appropriate accommodations, these students may struggle to fully participate in their courses and meet academic expectations.

One common argument against providing accommodations is that it gives unfair advantages to disabled students. Critics claim that by allowing extra time on exams or providing note-taking services, non-disabled students are put at a disadvantage. However, this argument fails to consider the fact that accommodations do not give disabled students an edge â€“ they simply level the playing field. Denying these students necessary supports only serves to further marginalize them and hinder their academic success.

Furthermore, failing to provide accommodations could result in legal consequences for universities under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). This federal law mandates that educational institutions must provide reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities in order prevent discrimination based on disability status. Universities must create accessible environments and adjust policies as needed in order ensure equal opportunities for all students.

Accommodations may include but are not limited extended time on exams, assistive technology such as screen readers or speech-to-text software, alternative testing formats (oral exams instead of written), note-taking services or access too classroom materials prior lectures among others things.This type of support helps break down barriers and allows disabled individuals succeed academically.
