In recent years, the rise of terrorism has become a significant global concern. From large-scale attacks in Western countries such as the United States and France to ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Africa, it is clear that terrorism is on the rise. In this essay, I will discuss some events and experiences that are contributing to this increase in terrorism.

One major factor contributing to the increase in terrorism is political instability and conflict in various regions around the world. The ongoing civil wars in Syria, Yemen, Afghanistan, Iraq, and other countries have created power vacuums that allow terrorist groups like ISIS and Al-Qaeda to thrive. These groups take advantage of weak governments and internal strife to recruit new members and expand their operations.

Furthermore, state-sponsored terrorism also plays a role in fostering extremism. Countries like Iran and North Korea have been accused of supporting terrorist organizations or carrying out terror attacks themselves. This sponsorship provides financial support, training, weapons, and safe havens for terrorists to carry out their activities.

Another event that has contributed to the rise of terrorism is social inequality and marginalization. Many individuals who join extremist groups do so because they feel marginalized or disenfranchised by society. They may feel discriminated against based on their religion, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status which can push them towards radical ideologies as a way of seeking revenge or empowerment.

Religious extremism is another key driver of terrorism today. Groups like ISIS use religion as a pretext for violence by distorting religious teachings to justify their actions. They target vulnerable individuals with promises of salvation through martyrdom while spreading fear among non-believers through brutal tactics like beheadings and suicide bombings.

Additionally economic factors such as poverty also play a role in driving people towards violent extremism .
