In today's educational landscape, diversity and inclusion have become important aspects of student life. As a result, universities are increasingly recognizing the importance of accommodating students with disabilities. The question of whether universities should provide accommodations to disabled students is a complex one that involves legal, moral, and practical considerations.

From a legal perspective, universities in many countries are required by law to provide reasonable accommodations to disabled students under anti-discrimination legislation such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in the United States or the Disability Discrimination Act in the UK. These laws mandate that colleges and universities must make necessary modifications or adjustments to ensure access for disabled individuals.

Moreover, providing accommodations to disabled students is not just a legal obligation but also a moral imperative. Education is a fundamental human right, and denying equal access to education for disabled individuals goes against principles of equality and social justice. By providing accommodations such as wheelchair ramps, captioned videos, sign language interpreters, or extended time for exams, universities can create an inclusive environment where all students have an equal opportunity to succeed.

Practically speaking, providing accommodations for disabled students benefits not only those individuals but also the university community at large. When students with disabilities are able to fully participate in academic activities without barriers, they can contribute their unique perspectives and talents to class discussions and group projects. This enriches the learning experience for all members of the university community.

Furthermore, accommodating disabled students can lead to increased retention rates and academic success among this population. Research has shown that when appropriate accommodations are made available to students with disabilities, they are more likely to stay enrolled in school and perform better academically compared to those who do not receive support.

However,some argue that providing accommodations for disabled students may be too costly or logistically challenging for some institutions.There may be concerns about limited resources available on campus or potential disruptions caused by making physical changes.Conversely,others might argue that failing provide these accomodations would be exclusionary.Also many accommodates like technology devices,cart services etc have been formed which makes accessibility easier 

In conclusion,it is clear that there are compelling reasons why universities should provide reasonable accomodations.Disability affects people from all backgrounds,and institutions needto take ppropriate measures tpo support these individual if we want inclusivity within our society .While there may be challenges associated with implementing these policies,the potential benefits far outweighs any disadvantages.Universities serve as avenuesfor growth,knowledge storehouses,and mot importantly platforms forsocioeconomic empowerment71%of extients will return ils benefit us all.datatables,'\
