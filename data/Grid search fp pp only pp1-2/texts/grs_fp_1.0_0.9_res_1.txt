In recent years, there has been an increasing awareness of the importance of inclusivity and accessibility for all individuals, including those with disabilities. One area where this issue is particularly relevant is in higher education institutions. Should universities provide accommodations to disabled students? This question has sparked a heated debate among academics, policymakers, and the general public.

Firstly, it is important to recognize that providing accommodations to disabled students is not just a matter of moral or ethical responsibility; it is also mandated by law. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires all public institutions, including universities, to provide reasonable accommodations to ensure that individuals with disabilities have equal access to educational opportunities. Failure to do so can result in legal repercussions for the institution.

Furthermore, providing accommodations to disabled students benefits not only the individual student but also the university as a whole. By creating an inclusive environment that supports diversity and equity, universities can attract a wider range of talented students from diverse backgrounds. This enriches the learning experience for all students and contributes to a more vibrant academic community.

Moreover, research has shown that accommodating disabled students can actually enhance academic performance and retention rates. When provided with appropriate support such as assistive technology, modified assignments, or additional time on exams, disabled students are better able to engage with course material and demonstrate their knowledge and skills. As a result, they are more likely to succeed academically and persist in their studies.
