Cartoons have long been a popular form of entertainment for children. From Mickey Mouse to SpongeBob SquarePants, animated characters have captured the hearts and imaginations of young viewers around the world. However, not all cartoons are created equal, and some can have negative effects on children, particularly when they contain violent content.

Violent cartoons are those that depict aggressive behavior, such as fighting, weapons use, or destruction of property. These types of shows can desensitize children to violence and lead to an increase in aggressive behavior in those who watch them regularly. This is because young minds are impressionable and may imitate what they see on screen without fully understanding the consequences.

One of the key ways in which violent cartoons can affect children is through desensitization. When kids are exposed to violence from a young age, they may become less sensitive to its impact and be more likely to accept it as normal behavior. Studies have shown that prolonged exposure to violent media can reduce empathy and increase tolerance for aggression in children.

Furthermore, watching violent cartoons can also lead to an increase in aggressive behavior among children. A study conducted by Anderson and Dill (2000) found that exposure to television violence was associated with increased levels of aggression over time among both boys and girls. Another research study by Linder & Gentile (2009) demonstrated a link between watching violent TV shows at age 14-16 with aggressive behaviors five years later.

Additionally, studies have shown that viewing violent content can also lead to higher rates of fear and anxiety among children. Young viewers who frequently watch shows with graphic content may develop irrational fears or exhibit symptoms of anxiety as a result of being exposed to frightening imagery at such a young age.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that parents limit their child's exposure to media violence during their formative years because it has been consistently linked with harmful effects including increased aggressiveness towards others later on in life (Brown et al., 2018). 

In conclusion, while cartoons are typically seen as harmless entertainment for kids, it is important for parents and guardians to be aware of the potential negative effects that certain types of cartoons – specifically those containing violence – may have on developing minds. By limiting exposure to these types of shows and actively engaging with their child's media consumption choices early on parents can help protect them from any potential harm associated with watching overly-violent programming.
