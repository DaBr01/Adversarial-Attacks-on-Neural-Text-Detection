In recent years, the issue of whether universities should provide accommodations to disabled students has become a topic of great debate. Some argue that universities have a moral and legal obligation to provide accommodations to all students, including those with disabilities, in order to create a more inclusive learning environment. Others believe that providing accommodations may give some students an unfair advantage over others, or that it is simply too costly for universities to implement such measures. 

One of the main arguments in favor of providing accommodations to disabled students is the moral imperative to ensure equal access and opportunities for all individuals. According to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which was passed in 1990, universities are required by law to provide reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities in order to ensure they have an equal opportunity for success. This includes things such as providing wheelchair ramps and accessible restrooms for students with physical disabilities, as well as assistive technology and note-takers for students with other types of disabilities.

Furthermore, providing accommodations can help level the playing field for disabled students and enable them to fully participate in their education. For example, allowing extra time on exams or providing sign language interpreters can help disabled students succeed academically without being hindered by their disability.

Additionally, failing to provide accommodations can put universities at risk of legal action from both current and prospective students. If a university is found not complying with ADA regulations, they could face lawsuits and negative publicity which could damage their reputation.

On the other hand, some argue that providing accommodations may give certain individuals an unfair advantage over others who do not need them. For example, granting extra time on exams may be seen as giving those students special treatment while also potentially disadvantaging other non-disabled student's chances.

Moreover, there are concerns about cost associated with implementing comprehensive accommodation measures across campus - especially if a large number of disabled student population requires different types of resources.

However these arguments detract from the bigger picture: ensuring all individuals - regardless of ability or disability - have full access and opportunities when it comes higher education.
