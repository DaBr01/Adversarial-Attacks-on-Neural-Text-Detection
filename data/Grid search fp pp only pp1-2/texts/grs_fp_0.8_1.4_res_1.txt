In recent years, there has been an increasing awareness of the importance of providing accommodations for disabled students at universities. The issue of whether or not universities should provide these accommodations is a complex and controversial one, with arguments on both sides. This essay will explore the reasons why universities should provide accommodations to disabled students.

One of the main reasons why universities should provide accommodations to disabled students is because it is their legal obligation under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The ADA requires that all public institutions, including universities, provide reasonable accommodations to individuals with disabilities in order to ensure that they have equal access to education. By failing to provide these accommodations, universities are violating federal law and denying disabled students their right to a quality education.

Furthermore, providing accommodations for disabled students can greatly enhance their academic success and overall well-being. Many disabled students face barriers in accessing educational materials, participating in class discussions, and completing assignments due to their disabilities. By providing accommodations such as extended exam time, assistive technology, note-taking services, and accessible classrooms, universities can help level the playing field for disabled students and give them an equal opportunity to succeed academically.

Additionally, providing accommodations for disabled students can benefit the entire university community by promoting diversity and inclusion. When universities make an effort to accommodate diverse student populations, including those with disabilities, they create a more inclusive environment where all individuals feel valued and respected. This not only benefits disabled students but also helps cultivate a culture of acceptance and understanding among all members of the university community.

On the other hand,

Some critics argue that providing accommodations for disabled students may create unfair advantages or lower academic standards at universities. They believe that accommodating disabled students may dilute the rigor of courses or compromise academic integrity by allowing certain individuals extra privileges or exemptions from course requirements. However,
this argument overlooks the fact that accommodation does not equate lowered standards; rather it ensures equitable opportunities for everyone regardless of physical or cognitive abilities.

Furthermore

Another common argument against providing accommodation is concerns over cost implications associated with implementing necessary changes within university infrastructure or hiring additional support staff specifically for catering towards needs unique 	to
disabled population.
