Terrorism is a complex and multifaceted issue that has plagued the world for decades. There are various theories and explanations as to why terrorism is on the rise, but in this research essay, I will focus on events and experiences that I agree are contributing to the increase in terrorism.

One major factor that is causing the increase in terrorism is the proliferation of extremist ideologies. With the rise of social media and online platforms, extremist groups have been able to spread their radical beliefs and recruit new members more easily than ever before. These groups prey on vulnerable individuals who may be disillusioned with their current circumstances or looking for a sense of belonging. The ability of these groups to radicalize individuals has led to an increase in terrorist activities around the world.

Another factor contributing to the increase in terrorism is political instability and conflict in certain regions. When countries are embroiled in civil wars or facing political turmoil, it creates fertile ground for terrorist organizations to thrive. These groups often take advantage of weak governance structures and widespread violence to further their own agendas. The ongoing conflicts in countries such as Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Nigeria have provided opportunities for terrorist groups like ISIS, Al-Qaeda, Boko Haram, and others to gain a foothold and carry out attacks with impunity.

Additionally, social alienation and discrimination can also play a role in driving individuals towards acts of terrorism. Marginalized communities may feel disenfranchised from society or face discrimination based on their ethnicity, religion, or other factors. This sense of isolation can create resentment and anger towards mainstream society, leading some individuals to seek out extremist groups that offer them a sense of identity and purpose. The feeling of being marginalized can drive individuals towards violent acts as a way to lash out against perceived injustices.

Furthermore, foreign interventions by western powers in various regions have also been cited as a factor contributing to the increase in terrorism. The invasion of Iraq in 2003 by the United States led to widespread chaos and instability, which allowed groups like ISIS to emerge and seize control of territory. Similarly, drone strikes carried out by western countries in countries such as Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia have resulted in civilian casualties that have fueled anti-western sentiment among local populations.

In conclusion events such as the proliferation of extremist ideologies online communal conflicts political instability social alienation discrimination marginalisation foreign interventions all contribute it is clear that there are numerous events and experiences that are contributing factorsin causing an increase int he number if tourists attacks throughoutt he world today
