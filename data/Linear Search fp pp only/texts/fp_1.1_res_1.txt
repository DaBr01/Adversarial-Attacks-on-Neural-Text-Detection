Universities play a crucial role in fostering learning, growth, and development for all students. However, not all students have the same needs or abilities, particularly those with disabilities. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated 15% of the world's population lives with some form of disability. Given this significant portion of the population, it is crucial for universities to provide accommodations to disabled students to ensure equal access to education and opportunities.

One of the primary reasons universities should provide accommodations to disabled students is to promote inclusivity and diversity on campuses. By offering accommodations such as wheelchair ramps, accessible bathrooms, assistive technologies, and specialized support services like sign language interpreters or note-takers, universities can create a more inclusive environment that values diversity and promotes equity among all students.

Furthermore, providing accommodations for disabled students can help level the playing field in academic settings. Many disabled students face unique challenges in accessing educational materials or participating in classroom activities due to their disabilities. For example, a student with dyslexia may require extra time during exams or alternative formats for reading assignments. By providing these accommodations, universities can ensure that all students have an equal opportunity to succeed academically.

In addition to promoting inclusivity and leveling the playing field academically, providing accommodations for disabled students is also required by law in many countries around the world. In the United States, for example, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in federally funded programs or activitiesâ€”including colleges and universities.
Similarly,
the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires public institutions
to provide reasonable accommodations
for individuals with disabilities,
including but not limited 
to accessible buildings
and facilities,
alternative testing methods,
and aids like interpreters 
or assistive technology.
Failure 
to comply 
with these laws could result
in legal repercussions 
for schools.
Thus,
universities have both ethical
and legal obligations 
to provide accommodations
for disabled students.
