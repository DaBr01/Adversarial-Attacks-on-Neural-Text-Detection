Animal experimentation has been a controversial topic for decades. Many argue that it is necessary for scientific progress and medical advancements, while others believe it is unethical and cruel to use animals in this way. However, when considering the well-being and rights of animals, it becomes clear that certain types of animal experiments should be illegal.

One main reason why using certain animals for experiments should be outlawed is the issue of cruelty. Animals used in research are often subject to painful procedures without any regard for their well-being or comfort. They may be subjected to surgeries, infections, toxic substances or other harmful treatments that cause suffering and distress.

Furthermore, many species used in experiments have complex cognitive abilities and social structures which makes their confinement even more detrimental to their mental health. For example, primates like chimpanzees are highly intelligent creatures with social hierarchies reminiscent of humans'. Subjecting them to isolation or invasive procedures can lead to severe emotional distress.

Additionally,, there are ethical considerations when asserting the appropriateness or necessity of animal experimentation If we value the lives our pets â€“ dogs,cats etc., why shouldn't we afford those same rights & consideration towards other needlessly experimented upon creatures? Animal testing does not only include trials done on rats,rabbits,stray cats/dogs but also extends into marginalized populations such as apes-amongst a plethora-of endangered species; almost entirely rendered helpless against unfeeling scientific institutions...and most crucially- human placental tissue which could provide greater breakthroughs/benefits disposition?
