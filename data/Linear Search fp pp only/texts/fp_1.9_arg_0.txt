The idea of allowing school students to curate their high school curriculum is a controversial one that has sparked much debate among educators, parents, and students alike. Some argue that giving students the power to choose their own classes would foster independence and personal responsibility, while others believe it could lead to a lack of structure and educational rigor.

Those in favor of allowing students to curate their high school curriculum point to the benefits of personalized learning. Every student has different interests and learning styles, so letting them choose courses based on those preferences can help them stay engaged and motivated throughout their education. Students who are more invested in what they are studying are likely to perform better academically. Additionally, giving them the freedom to select their own classes can empower them by making decisions about their education.

Another argument for student-led curriculum curation is that it can help prepare young people for life after graduation. In college or in a career setting, individuals must make choices about what courses or projects they pursue based on personal interests or goals. Giving high schoolers practice with this decision-making process early on can help develop important skills like time management, critical thinking, and self-advocacy.

However compelling these arguments may be at first glance , there are also significant drawbacks when considering whether school students should have complete control over selecting classes themselves . Firstly , teenagers  have not fully developed cognitive abilities as adults do . They may not fully understand how certain subjects relate back directly community standards such as values , ethics etc .
