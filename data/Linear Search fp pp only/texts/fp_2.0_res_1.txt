In today's society, the issue of providing accommodations for disabled students in higher education has become increasingly important. Disabled students face numerous challenges when it comes to accessing and participating in higher education, and it is essential for universities to provide necessary support and accommodations to ensure these students have equal opportunities for success.

One argument in favor of universities providing accommodations to disabled students is that doing so ensures equality of opportunity. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires educational institutions to make reasonable modifications or adjustments that allow people with disabilities equal access to programs, services, and activities. By not making appropriate accommodations available, universities are effectively denying disabled individuals the tools they need tO succeed academically.

Additionally, providing accommodations can also benefit all students on campus by fostering a more inclusive environment. When schools create an accessible learning environment that meets the needs of all their diverse student population—including those with disabilities—they foster a sense of respect and acceptance among everyone on campus.
