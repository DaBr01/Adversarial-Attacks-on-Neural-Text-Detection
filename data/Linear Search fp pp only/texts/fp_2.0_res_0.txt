Violent cartoons have been a subject of controversy for many years, with concerns raised about their potential impact on children's behavior and attitudes. While some argue that these cartoons are harmless entertainment, others believe that they can have negative effects on young viewers. In this essay, we will explore the various ways in which violent cartoons can influence children's thoughts and actions.

Firstly, it is important to consider how exposure to violence in cartoons can desensitize children to real-life aggression. Research has shown that repeated exposure to violent content can lead individuals to become less sensitive towards violence and more accepting of aggressive behavior (Anderson et al., 2003). This desensitization effect may make it easier for children who watch violent cartoons regularly to engage in aggressive behaviors themselves or view such behavior as normal.

Moreover, studies have also found a link between watching violent media content and increased levels of aggression in children. The General Aggression Model proposes that viewing violence leads individuals' thoughts processes down an aggressive path due to priming mechanisms triggered by repeated exposure (Bushman & Anderson, 2002). Consequently, regular consumption of violent television shows or videos has the potential not only affect kids' views on conflicts but also increase the likelihood of them behaving aggressively towards others.

In addition to behavioral changes, exposure to violent content may also impact cognitive development among young viewers. For example, research suggests that prolonged periods spent watching fast-paced and action-packed animations could hinder kids' attention spans over time (Lillard & Peterson; Tversky & Hard), which might negatively influence their academic performance at schoolrespected randomized control trial performed by Lillard et al.).

Despite these concerning findings there is still ongoing debate around whether censorship would be effective approach cutting off sources like national broadcasting companies favorting free speech advocated banning versus streamlined warning label systems
