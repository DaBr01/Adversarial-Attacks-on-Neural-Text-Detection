In recent years, there has been a growing trend towards personalization and individualization in education, with an increasing focus on student agency and choice. One area where this trend is particularly relevant is in the high school curriculum. Traditionally, school students have had little say in the courses they are required to take, with a standardized set of subjects being mandated by the school or educational authority. However, there is a growing movement towards allowing students to have more input into their own learning by curating their high school curriculum. 

One argument in favor of allowing students to curate their high school curriculum is that it can increase engagement and motivation. When students have the opportunity to choose courses that align with their interests and goals, they are more likely to be enthusiastic about learning and put in the effort required to succeed. Allowing students to select courses based on their interests can also help them develop a sense of ownership over their education, which can lead to increased self-confidence and self-efficacy.

Furthermore, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum can help them better prepare for future academic or career pathways. By choosing courses that align with their interests or future goals, students can gain valuable skills and knowledge that will be beneficial in college or the workforce. For example, a student interested in pursuing a career in computer science may benefit from taking additional coding classes rather than being required to take traditional science courses.

Critics of allowing students to curate their high school curriculum may argue that it could lead to academic gaps or lack of essential knowledge. They may worry that without clear guidelines or requirements for all students, some may opt out of foundational subjects such as math or English which are necessary for success in higher education or certain careers.

However, proponents argue that by setting clear guidelines around core subjects while still allowing flexibility for elective options, schools can strike a balance between ensuring all students receive a well-rounded education while also providing space for individual exploration and growth.

In conclusion, I believe that school students should be allowed more agency in curating their high school curriculum. Allowing students to choose courses based on interest and future goals can increase engagement and motivation while also helping them prepare for future educational or career pathways. By providing both structure around core subjects as well as flexibility for electives, schools can empower students to take ownership of their learning while still ensuring they receive a comprehensive education.
