Animal experimentation has been a controversial topic for decades. Many people argue that it is necessary for scientific advancements and medical breakthroughs, while others believe that it is cruel and unnecessary to use animals in such a way. In my opinion, certain types of animals should not be used for experiments and other research purposes because it is unethical and often yields unreliable results.

Firstly, using certain types of animals, such as primates or dogs, for experiments can be considered unethical due to the suffering they endure during the process. These animals are often subjected to painful procedures without their consent, causing them distress and harm. They may experience physical pain or emotional stress as a result of being confined in small cages or undergoing invasive surgeries. This treatment can lead to long-term negative consequences on their well-being.

Furthermore, these animals have no control over their environment or what happens to them during the experiment. They are simply seen as tools for scientists to use in order to achieve their desired results. This lack of autonomy goes against the ethical principle that all living beings deserve respect and consideration.

In addition to being unethical, using certain types of animals for experiments can also yield unreliable results. Animals do not always respond the same way humans do when exposed to certain substances or conditions due to differences in physiology and genetics between species. Therefore, findings from animal studies may not accurately predict how humans will react in similar situations.

For example, many drugs that have shown promise in animal trials have failed when tested on humans because our biological systems are so different from those of other species.Therefore,the potential benefits obtained from animal testing may be misleading leading us down dead end paths wasting both resources,time,money 0and most importantly precious human lives

Alternatives such as cell cultures,tissue models,and computer simulations exist which could provide more accurate information about human biology than traditional animal testing methods.Although an full replacement model might seem unattainable at current technological level partial replacements must increasingly become available with rapid advancements
in science.With technology rapidly increasing,it creates an opportunity where we look into smarter alternatives rather then making poor creatures suffer 

In conclusion,certain types nimals,such ass primates,dogs etc.,should be banned form research process.They share cranial nerve structures,responses,tissues,gastro digestive processes etc,nearly identical with Humans.Genomic variations increase similarities.Even though along this decision consideration must also extend towards bettering ailments faced by pets observational care rather then exploitative target practices.Animals related differential genotypic traits put substantive focus onto humane steps thereby shedding brutal burdens off looking glass into furtherance developments which would culminate judicious two sided cooperation between two domains Helpless Creatures vs Conquering Humans
