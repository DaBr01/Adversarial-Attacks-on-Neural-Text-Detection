Should school students be allowed to curate their high school curriculum? This question has been a topic of debate for many years, with strong arguments on both sides. Some believe that allowing students to choose their own curriculum will empower them and help foster a love of learning. Others argue that giving students this type of control could lead to gaps in their education and create unfair advantages for some students.

One of the main arguments in favor of allowing students to curate their high school curriculum is that it can help them develop a sense of ownership over their education. By choosing the subjects and courses they are most interested in, students are more likely to be engaged and motivated to learn. This can result in higher academic achievement and a greater passion for learning.

Furthermore, allowing students to curate their curriculum can also help them prepare for the future by focusing on subjects that align with their career goals or interests. For example, a student who wants to pursue a career in computer science may choose to take advanced math and science courses, while someone interested in journalism may focus on English and writing classes.

Additionally, giving students more control over their curriculum can help address issues such as boredom or disengagement in the classroom. If students are able to choose courses that spark their curiosity and creativity, they are more likely to be actively involved in their education.

On the other hand, opponents argue that allowing students too much freedom in choosing their high school curriculum could result in gaps in important subject areas. For example, if a student only chooses courses based on personal interests without considering core subjects like math or science, they may graduate without essential skills needed for college or the workforce.

Furthermore, some believe that allowing students to choose their own curriculum could create unfair advantages for those who have access to information about different career paths or academic opportunities. Students from more privileged backgrounds may have parents or counselors who can guide them toward selecting courses that will give them an advantage when applying for college or jobs.

In conclusion, while there are valid arguments on both sides of this issue, I believe that school students should be allowed at least some level of input into curating their high school curriculum. Allowing students to have agency over what they learn can increase engagement and motivation while helping them prepare for future careers. However, it is important for educators and parents to provide guidance and support throughout this process to ensure that all students receive a well-rounded education that prepares them for success in life.
