In recent years, terrorism has become a growing global concern with devastating consequences for individuals, families, communities, and nations. While there are various factors contributing to the rise of terrorism around the world, certain events and experiences are widely agreed upon as key drivers of this trend.

One major factor that many experts believe is driving the increase in terrorism is political instability and conflict in regions such as the Middle East and North Africa. These regions have been plagued by long-standing conflicts and power struggles which have created fertile ground for extremist groups like ISIS to recruit followers. The lack of stable governments in these areas has allowed terrorist organizations to establish strongholds from which they can carry out attacks both locally and internationally.

Another significant event that fuels terrorism is social inequality and marginalization experienced by marginalized groups within societies. When people feel disenfranchised or discriminated against due to their ethnicity, religion or economic status, they may be more susceptible to radical ideologies that promise them a sense of belonging or empowerment through violence. This sense of alienation drives some individuals towards extremist groups who offer them an alternative form of identity based on hatred towards others deemed responsible for their suffering.

Furthermore ,the spread of hate speech through social media platforms also plays a role in inciting acts fo terrorim . Extremist propaganda disseminated online often targets vulnerable individuals looking for meaning or purpose ,and persuades them into carrying out violent acts against innocent civilians .

In addition ,widespread economic exclusion resulting from poverty  can also drive peopelt o participate i n terroiristic activities For example high unemployment rates coupled with inadequate access tol ivelihood opportintyies culation food insecurity ma yle boyuthem ot join terrrisitica organisations t
