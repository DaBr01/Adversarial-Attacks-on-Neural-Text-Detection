The death sentence, also known as capital punishment, has been a topic of debate for centuries. While some argue that it is necessary to maintain law and order and deter criminals from committing heinous crimes, others believe that it is a violation of human rights and can lead to the execution of innocent individuals. The question remains: should the death sentence be implemented globally?

One argument in favor of implementing the death penalty worldwide is that it serves as a deterrent for potential criminals. The fear of facing the ultimate punishment may prevent individuals from committing serious crimes such as murder or terrorism. In countries where capital punishment is still carried out, crime rates are often lower compared to those where it has been abolished.

Additionally, proponents of the death penalty argue that it provides closure and justice for victims' families. Knowing that the perpetrator will never have an opportunity to harm another individual can bring a sense of peace and satisfaction to those affected by the crime. In cases where there is overwhelming evidence against the accused, executing them may provide a sense of closure for both victims' families and society as a whole.

On the other hand, opponents argue that implementing the death sentence globally is inhumane and violates basic human rights. Taking someone's life as a form of punishment goes against principles such as respect for human dignity and right to life - principles enshrined in international human rights conventions like Universal Declaration on Human Rights (UDHR). Additionally, there have been numerous cases where innocent individuals have been wrongfully convicted and sentenced to death only to be exonerated later through DNA evidence or other means.

Furthermore, studies have shown that there is no conclusive evidence proving that capital punishment acts as an effective deterrent against crime. In fact, many criminologists believe that social factors such as poverty levels or lack of education play a more significant role in criminal behavior than fear of punishment does.

It must also be considered how implementing global use could lead certain governments with questionable judicial systems abusing this power by using it unjustly against political opposition or marginalized populations within their own country which would further worsen problems rather than solve them.
In conclusion while certain arguments might claim its necessity however when considering its effectiveness versus costly procedure & real risk executing innocents we could see overall abolition shows better long term benefits therefore too risky & needlessly cruel practice eliminated entirely .
