In today's education system, students are often restricted to a set curriculum that is decided by the school or district. However, many argue that students should have more control over their high school education by being allowed to curate their own curriculum. This would give students the ability to tailor their learning experience to better suit their individual interests and goals.

One of the main arguments in favor of allowing students to curate their high school curriculum is that it can increase engagement and motivation. When students have a say in what they are learning, they are more likely to be interested and invested in their education. By choosing subjects that they are passionate about, students are more likely to put in the effort to succeed and excel in those areas. This can lead to better academic performance and a more positive overall high school experience.

Additionally, allowing students to curate their own curriculum can help them prepare for the future. High school is a time when students are beginning to think about potential career paths and college majors. Allowing students to choose courses that align with their interests and goals can help them explore different fields and gain valuable skills that will be beneficial in their future endeavors. For example, a student interested in pursuing a career in computer science could focus on taking more STEM-related courses while someone interested in the arts could take more creative classes.

Furthermore, letting students curate their high school curriculum can also promote independence and critical thinking skills. When students are given the responsibility to choose their courses, they must consider their goals, interests, and abilities. This requires decision-making skills and the ability to plan ahead, which are important qualities that will serve students well in their future endeavors. Additionally, having the freedom to customize their education can encourage students to think critically about what they want to learn and why, promoting a deeper understanding of subjects.

On the other hand, some may argue that allowing students to curate their high school curriculum could lead to gaps in knowledge and limited exposure to certain subjects. However, this can be addressed by implementing guidelines or requirements to ensure that students are exposed to a well-rounded education. For example, students could be required to take a minimum number of credits in core subjects such as English, math, science, and history, while still having the flexibility to choose elective courses based on their interests.

In conclusion, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum can have numerous benefits including increased engagement, better preparation for the future, and the promotion of independence and critical thinking skills. By giving students the freedom to choose their courses, we empower them to take ownership of their education and tailor their learning experience to better suit their individual needs and goals. Ultimately, this approach can lead to more motivated, successful, and well-rounded students.
