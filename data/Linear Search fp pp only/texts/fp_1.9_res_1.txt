Universities are institutions that provide education to individuals from all walks of life. In recent years, there has been a growing awareness and emphasis on providing equal opportunities for all students, including those with disabilities. This has led to the question of whether universities should provide accommodations to disabled students.

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal law that prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in public spaces, including educational institutions. Under this law, universities are required to provide reasonable accommodations for disabled students in order to ensure they have access to the same educational opportunities as their non-disabled peers.

One argument in favor of providing accommodations for disabled students is that it helps level the playing field and promotes equality among all students. By providing necessary accommodations such as assistive technology, accessible buildings and facilities, extended testing time or note-taking services, universities can help ensure that disabled students have an equal opportunity to succeed academically.

Furthermore, accommodating disabled students not only benefits those individuals directly but also enriches the overall university community by promoting diversity and inclusion. Disabled individuals bring unique perspectives and experiences that can enhance classroom discussions and foster a more inclusive learning environment for everyone.

Moreover,, failing .providing appropriate accommodation 
 could hinder disable student academic performance achievement further perpetuating inequality within higher education
