When it comes to improving accessibility for people with physical disabilities, the government plays a crucial role in creating a more inclusive society. While progress has been made in recent years to make public spaces and services more accessible, there is still much work to be done. In this essay, I will argue that the government should do more to improve accessibility for people with physical disabilities.

First and foremost, it is essential that individuals with physical disabilities have equal access to all aspects of society. This includes public transportation, buildings, parks and recreation facilities, as well as information technology. Unfortunately, many places are still not fully accessible for those with mobility issues or other impairments. By implementing better policies and regulations around accessibility standards – such as required ramps or elevators - the government can help bridge this gap.

Furthermore,,improving accessibilitesmeans economic benefits both at an individual level (greater inclusion in workforce)and at large(scavenging productivity). According,a study conducted by Deloitte Access Economics shows that every dollar spent on making infrastructure accessible yields a return on investment of $2-4 due higher participation rates withinour communities.Businesses stand benefitedaswell fromthisas they would gainaccessseveral million potential customers who strugglewith existing setup.Additionally,governments could savebillions throughdecreasing expenditureinvolvedin medicaltreatment andrehabilitation measures linkedto  lackofproperlyAccessibleinfrastructure.(InternationalLabour Organization[ILA], 2011)

Onestrongcounterargument against these pointsisthat "Very little directevidence hasbeenmade availableabout return-on-investment frommaking infrastructuremoreaccessible’".Such claimis supportedbyFeustelRowles,G.Stark,Branston,S.McNamara,B.&Vincent,M.Whocontend"Thatthoughincreasing job opportunitiesarealogo aim;yettoseasured.returnoneyieldfromsuch.TiletaoTWSassociatedcostshave,yet.it maintained"(2015).
