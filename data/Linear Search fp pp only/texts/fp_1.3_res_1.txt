The question of whether universities should provide accommodations to disabled students is a complex and important one. The answer to this question depends on why we have universities in the first place, what their role is in society, and what principles they should uphold. In this essay, I argue that providing accommodations to disabled students is not only necessary but also morally imperative.

Firstly, it is crucial to recognize that education should be accessible to all individuals, regardless of their physical or mental disabilities. Universities are meant to be institutions where knowledge is created and disseminated for the betterment of society as a whole. By excluding disabled students from accessing higher education opportunities, we are depriving them of their fundamental right to learn and grow intellectually. As such, it is essential for universities to provide accommodations that enable these students to fully participate in academic life.

Secondly, failing to accommodate disabled students goes against principles of inclusivity and equal opportunity. In today's world, diversity has become increasingly valued across all sectors of society – including educational institutions. By ignoring the needs of disabled individuals and not making reasonable adjustments for them within university settings, we are perpetuating discriminatory practices that segregate rather than integrate different marginalized groups into mainstream society.

Furthermore, providing accommodations can benefit not just individual disabled students but also enrich the overall university environment as a whole. When universities welcome diverse perspectives and experiences into their classrooms and campus life – including those from people with disabilities – they foster an environment where everyone can thrive intellectually through meaningful engagement with others who bring different viewpoints on disability-related issues.
