Accessibility is a critical issue that affects millions of people with physical disabilities around the world. Despite progress in recent years, there is still much work to be done to improve accessibility for this population. In many countries, individuals with physical disabilities continue to face significant barriers when trying to access public spaces, transportation systems, and other essential services.

There are several reasons why the government should do more to improve accessibility for people with physical disabilities. First and foremost, it is a matter of basic human rights. Everyone deserves equal access to opportunities and services regardless of their physical abilities. By failing to address accessibility issues, governments are effectively discriminating against individuals with disabilities by limiting their ability to participate fully in society.

Secondly, improving accessibility can have far-reaching benefits for society as a whole. When public spaces and transportation systems are made accessible for people with physical disabilities, they also become more usable for everyone else. For example, ramps installed at entrances can benefit parents pushing strollers or travelers pulling luggage just as much as they benefit wheelchair users.

Furthermore,, there is an economic argument in favor of improving accessibility for people with physical disabilities.Many businesses fail-to comply-with regulations concerning disability-accessibility.Unfortunately,it's not something that all establishments see it important.Nearly one-fifth (18 per cent) o f Brits feel unable or uncomfortable walking up steps on both legs,greatly hindering those living -with- mobilityrestricitions.For some companies,this could mean losing revenue from potential customers who are not able-"Walk through steps.Accessibility improvements could in fact lead tp higher footfall,and greater profit margins
