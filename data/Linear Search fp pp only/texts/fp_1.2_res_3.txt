Technology and gadgets have become an integral part of our daily lives, affecting various aspects including education. Children are growing up in a world filled with smartphones, tablets, laptops, and other devices that offer endless opportunities for learning and entertainment. While technology can enhance the educational experience for children in many ways, it also has its downsides when it comes to their studies.

One of the most significant impacts of technology and gadgets on children's studies is the potential distraction they pose. With instant access to social media, games, videos, and other forms of entertainment at their fingertips, children may find it challenging to stay focused on their schoolwork. The constant notifications and alerts from their devices can interrupt their concentration and lead to decreased productivity during study sessions.

Moreover, excessive screen time has been linked to a variety of negative effects on children's cognitive development. Spending too much time interacting with screens can  impact brain function by reducing attention span and memory retention capabilities. This can make it harder for children to absorb information from textbooks or lectures when studying for exams or completing homework assignments.
