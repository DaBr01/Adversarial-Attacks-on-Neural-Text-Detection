The traditional model of education has long dictated a set curriculum for high school students, with little to no input from the students themselves. However, in today's rapidly changing world, where individualized learning and personal interests are increasingly valued, the question arises: should school students be allowed to curate their high school curriculum?

One argument in favor of allowing students to curate their own high school curriculum is that it promotes personal growth and autonomy. When given the opportunity to choose subjects that interest them or align with their future goals, students are more likely to be engaged and motivated in their studies. This can lead to better academic performance and overall satisfaction with their education.

Furthermore, allowing students to curate their own curriculum can help them develop crucial skills such as time management, decision-making, and self-discipline. By taking ownership of their learning experience, students can learn how to prioritize tasks and manage deadlines effectively. They must also consider various factors when choosing courses - such as prerequisites or graduation requirements - which requires critical thinking skills.

Moreover allows diversity among educational objectives for different individuals meaning varied perspectives may influence outcomes positively.
Another potential benefit of student-curated curricula is the promotion of creativity and innovation. When given the freedom to explore new subjects or pursue unique projects outside traditional coursework,
