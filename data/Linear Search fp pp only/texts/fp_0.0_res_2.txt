Events and experiences that many experts agree are fueling the increase in terrorism include geopolitics, socioeconomic factors, and the spread of extremist ideologies. These events and experiences create fertile ground for extremist groups to recruit and radicalize individuals, leading to a rise in terrorist activities around the world.

One of the primary factors contributing to the increase in terrorism is geopolitics. The ongoing conflicts in countries such as Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Yemen have created power vacuums and instability, allowing terrorist groups like ISIS and Al-Qaeda to thrive. These groups exploit the chaos and despair in these regions to recruit fighters and carry out attacks both locally and internationally. Additionally, the involvement of foreign powers in these conflicts, such as the United States, Russia, and Iran, further complicates the situation and fuels grievances among local populations, providing terrorists with more recruits and support.

Socioeconomic factors also play a significant role in the increase in terrorism. Poverty, unemployment, lack of education, and social inequality create conditions where individuals are more susceptible to extremist ideologies and recruitment by terrorist groups. In many countries, marginalized and disenfranchised populations, particularly young men, are drawn to terrorist organizations as a way to gain purpose, status, and economic opportunities that they feel are lacking in their own societies. Addressing these root causes of terrorism through economic development, education, and social inclusion is crucial in preventing and countering the spread of extremist ideologies.

The spread of extremist ideologies, particularly through the internet and social media, is another important factor contributing to the increase in terrorism. Radical groups use these platforms to disseminate propaganda, recruit followers, and inspire attacks worldwide. The ease of access to extremist content online allows individuals to self-radicalize and carry out acts of terrorism without direct contact with a terrorist organization. This decentralization of terrorism poses a significant challenge to law enforcement and intelligence agencies, as it is increasingly difficult to monitor and prevent lone-wolf attacks.

In conclusion, events and experiences such as geopolitics, socioeconomic factors, and the spread of extremist ideologies are driving the increase in terrorism. Addressing these root causes through diplomatic, economic, and social means is essential in preventing and countering the spread of violent extremism. International cooperation and coordination among governments, civil society, and the private sector are also crucial in effectively tackling the complex and multifaceted threat of terrorism in the 21st century. By understanding and addressing the underlying factors that contribute to terrorism, we can work towards building a more peaceful and secure world for future generations.
