Events and experiences that contribute to the increase in terrorism are multi-faceted and complex. While there is no single cause of terrorism, certain factors have been identified as possible contributors to its rise. These include political grievances, religious extremism, economic inequality, social injustice, and foreign interventions.

One of the key events that have fueled the increase in terrorism is political grievances. Many terrorist organizations justify their actions as a response to perceived injustices committed by governments or other groups against their people. This sense of injustice can motivate individuals to join extremist groups and carry out violent acts in retaliation for what they perceive as oppressive actions by those in power.

Religious extremism also plays a significant role in fueling terrorism around the world. Groups like ISIS and Al-Qaeda use religion as a tool to recruit members and justify their violent actions. The belief in an extremist interpretation of Islam or other religions can lead individuals to commit acts of terror with the belief that they are carrying out God's will.

Economic inequality is another factor that contributes to the increase in terrorism. Poverty and lack of opportunity can push individuals towards radical ideologies as a way to vent frustrations or seek meaning through violence. Economic disparities between different regions or countries can create fertile ground for recruitment by terrorist organizations offering financial incentives or promises of a better life.

Social injustice is also a driving force behind the rise in terrorism globally. Discrimination based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender or sexual orientation can create feelings of resentment among marginalized communities who may then turn towards violent extremism as a means of seeking justice or revenge against those who oppress them.
