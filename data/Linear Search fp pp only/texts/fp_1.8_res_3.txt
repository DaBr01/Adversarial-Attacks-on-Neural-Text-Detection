In today's digital age, technology and gadgets play a significant role in the lives of children. From smartphones and tablets to laptops and gaming consoles, these devices have become an integral part of their daily routine. While technology has its benefits in terms of education and entertainment, it also raises concerns about how it can affect the studies of children.

One way that technology impacts children's studies is through distractions. With access to social media platforms, online games, and instant messaging apps at their fingertips, students often find themselves easily distracted from their schoolwork. The constant notifications and alerts from these sources can hinder their ability to focus on studying or completing homework assignments.

Additionally, excessive screen time has been linked to decreased academic performance among students. Research has shown that prolonged use of electronic devices can lead to issues such as poor concentration, reduced memory retention, and lack of critical thinking skills - all essential components for academic success.

Furthermore, the use of gadgets during nighttime hours can disrupt sleep patterns which are crucial for learning abilities in children. Blue light emitted from screens interferes with the production of melatonin - a hormone that regulates sleep cycles - leading to disturbances in sleeping habits which ultimately affects overall academic performance.
