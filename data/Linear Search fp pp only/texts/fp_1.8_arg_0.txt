The debate surrounding whether or not school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum has been ongoing for years. On one hand, some argue that giving students the freedom to choose what courses they take will allow them to tailor their education to fit their individual interests and goals. On the other hand, critics believe that young students may not have enough knowledge or experience to make informed decisions about their academic path.

One of the main arguments in favor of allowing students to curate their high school curriculum is that it promotes independence and autonomy. By giving young people a say in what they study, schools can empower them and encourage personal responsibility for learning. This approach also helps foster a sense of ownership over one's education, which can lead to increased motivation and engagement in class.

Furthermore, allowing students to choose courses based on their interests can help prepare them for future careers or higher education paths. For example, a student who is passionate about science may want to focus more on biology courses while another student who loves writing might prefer taking extra English classes. Allowing these choices could pave the way for more specialized studies at later stages of schooling or university.

Moreover, when given the opportunity
to select subjects based on personal interests,
students are likely
to perform better academically.
Studies have shown 
that when learners are engaged 
and motivated by topics they are passionate about,
they tend
to excel in those areas.
This means that allowng
students more control over thier
 
academic journey could result
 
in better grades,
higher levels of achievement,
and overall success.
