The death sentence, or capital punishment, has long been a controversial topic around the world. While some countries still actively practice it as a form of punishment for serious crimes such as murder and terrorism, others have abolished it entirely. The question remains: should the death sentence be implemented globally?

Proponents of the death penalty argue that it serves as a deterrent to crime. They believe that knowing they could face execution if caught committing heinous crimes will discourage potential offenders from breaking the law in the first place. Additionally, supporters argue that certain criminals are beyond rehabilitation and pose a continued threat to society if left alive.

However, there is significant evidence to suggest that these arguments are flawed. Numerous studies have shown little to no correlation between the existence of the death penalty and crime rates in countries where it is still practiced. In fact, many experts believe that factors such as poverty levels and social inequality play a much larger role in driving crime rates than fear of execution.

Furthermore, there have been numerous cases where innocent individuals have been wrongfully convicted and sentenced to death only to be exonerated later thanks to advancements in DNA technology or new evidence coming forward proving their innocence. The irreversible nature of execution means there is always a risk of executing an innocent person - an outcome which can never be rectified once carried out.

Another key argument against implementing global capital punishment revolves around human rights violations. The right-to-life principle lies at heart when considering whether or not state-sanctioned killing can ever truly align with international human rights standards outlined by organizations like Amnesty International or Human Rights Watch.
Additionally,it's important consider how arbitrary sentencing has led marginalized groups disproportionately impacted because every jurisdiction defines ‘most severe’ differently thus opening up individual bias.
