The education system has remained relatively unchanged for decades, with students being required to follow a rigid curriculum set by the school and state. However, with the rise of personalized learning and the acknowledgment that all students have different learning styles and interests, there is a growing debate about whether school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum.

Proponents of allowing students to curate their high school curriculum argue that it can lead to greater engagement and motivation. When students have a say in what they are learning, they are more likely to be invested in their education and take ownership of their learning. This can lead to higher academic achievement, as students are more likely to put in the effort when they are genuinely interested in the subject matter.

Furthermore, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum can help them develop important skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and decision-making. By choosing their own courses and subjects, students are forced to think about their interests, strengths, and goals, which can help them develop a clearer understanding of themselves and what they want to achieve in the future.

Additionally, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum can better prepare them for the real world. In college and the workforce, individuals are often required to make decisions about their own learning and career paths. By giving students the opportunity to choose their own courses in high school, they are better equipped to navigate these decisions later in life.

On the other hand, opponents of allowing students to curate their high school curriculum argue that it can lead to a lack of essential knowledge and skills. They argue that students may choose to only study subjects that interest them, neglecting important core subjects that are necessary for a well-rounded education. This could limit the opportunities available to students in the future and hinder their ability to succeed in college or the workforce.

Furthermore, opponents argue that allowing students to curate their high school curriculum could perpetuate inequality. Students from privileged backgrounds may have access to more resources and information about different courses and subjects, giving them an advantage over students from disadvantaged backgrounds who may not have the same level of guidance and support. This could widen the achievement gap and further disadvantage already marginalized students.

In conclusion, while there are valid arguments on both sides of the debate, I believe that school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum. By giving students more agency over their education, we can foster greater engagement, motivation, and skill development. However, it is essential to provide students with guidance and support to ensure they are making informed decisions that will set them up for success in the future. Ultimately, empowering students to take control of their learning can lead to a more effective and equitable education system.
