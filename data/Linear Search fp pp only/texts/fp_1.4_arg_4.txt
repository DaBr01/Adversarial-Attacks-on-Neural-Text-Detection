In today's modern society, it is essential that the government takes action to improve accessibility for people with physical disabilities. People with physical disabilities face numerous challenges on a daily basis, and it is the responsibility of the government to ensure that they have equal access to facilities, services, and opportunities.

One of the main reasons why the government should do more to improve accessibility for people with physical disabilities is because it is a matter of human rights. According to Article 9 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, all individuals have the right to access public buildings, transportation systems, and information in a manner that respects their autonomy and dignity. By failing to provide accessible facilities and services for people with physical disabilities, governments are violating their basic human rights.

Furthermore‚ improving accessibility for people with physical disabilities benefits society as a whole. When individuals with physical disabilities are able to access education‚ employment‚ healthcare‚ and recreational activities‚ they can contribute positively to their communities by sharing their talents‚ skills‚ and experiences. By promoting inclusion and diversity within society through accessible infrastructure systems' governments can create an environment where everyone feels valued.
