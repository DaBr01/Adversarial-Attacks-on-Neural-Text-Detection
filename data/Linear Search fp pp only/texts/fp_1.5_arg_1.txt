Physical education plays a crucial role in the school system by promoting the overall well-being and development of students. Despite some opinions that physical education is unnecessary or less important than academic subjects, it should remain an integral part of every school curriculum.

First and foremost, physical education helps students stay physically fit and healthy. In today's world where childhood obesity rates are on the rise, it is more important than ever to instill healthy lifestyle habits at a young age. Physical education classes provide an opportunity for students to engage in regular exercise and learn about proper nutrition, setting them up for a lifetime of good health.

Moreover, physical education promotes social skills and teamwork among students. Through team sports and group activities, students learn how to communicate effectively with their peers, work towards common goals, and resolve conflicts constructively. These interpersonal skills are essential for success both academically and personally.

Furthermore, physical education has been shown to improve academic performance. Research indicates that regular exercise can increase concentration levels, improve memory retention, enhance cognitive function, reduce stress levels â€“ all of which can positively impact student achievement in the classroom.

In addition to these benefits on individual health and academics,
physical education also instills discipline , hard work , time management into children's lives . Athletes generally tend do better at their job place because they already know how much fire one needs to get through tough times

Opponents may argue that time spent on physical education could be better allocated towards core academic subjects such as mathematics or science. However , many studies have shown this not only does not impair student growth but actually adds productivity . When schools prioritize mental well being as much as marks themselves there will be significant improvement .

Overall ,It seems clear that Physical Education classes should continue being mandatory :

- They help keep children active
- Build life long healthier habits 
- Improve social network 
-Mental development 
-Learning team spirit
