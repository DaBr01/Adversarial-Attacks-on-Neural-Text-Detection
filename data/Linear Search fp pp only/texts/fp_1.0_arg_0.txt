Education is a critical component of an individual's development, and the curriculum followed in schools plays a crucial role in shaping students' knowledge, skills, and future opportunities. Traditionally, the school curriculum has been designed by educational experts and policymakers to ensure that students receive a well-rounded education that covers essential subjects. However, there is an ongoing debate about whether school students should have the freedom to curate their high school curriculum based on their interests and career goals.

Proponents of allowing students to curate their high school curriculum argue that it can lead to better engagement and academic outcomes. By giving students the freedom to choose the subjects they are passionate about or interested in, they are more likely to be motivated to learn and perform well academically. This autonomy can also help them develop important skills such as decision-making, time management, and self-discipline.

Furthermore, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum can be beneficial in preparing them for further education or entering the workforce. Students who have a clear vision of their career goals can tailor their coursework accordingly by focusing on subjects that are relevant to their chosen field. This specialization can give them a competitive edge when applying for colleges or jobs in the future.

Another argument in favor of allowing students to curate their high school curriculum is that it promotes individualized learning experiences. Every student has unique strengths, weaknesses, interests, and learning styles. Allowing them to choose their own courses can help cater to these individual differences and create a more personalized learning experience. Students may also be more inclined to take ownership of their education when they have a say in what they study.

On the other hand, opponents argue that allowing students too much freedom when it comes to selecting courses could result in them missing out on essential knowledge or skills needed for success later in life. Some may argue that teenagers do not always have enough maturity or insight into what is best for them academically and professionally.

Additionally,, some people believe that curation could lead some students
to focus solely on subjects they enjoy â€“ like art or music - at the expense of fundamental disciplines such as math,
science,
or English.
Therefore,
they argue
that standardization helps ensure all essential topics are covered evenly among all
students

In conclusion,
