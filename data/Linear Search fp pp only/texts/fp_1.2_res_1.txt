The topic of whether universities should provide accommodations to disabled students is a complex and contentious issue. On one hand, providing accommodations can help level the playing field and ensure that all students have an equal opportunity to succeed. On the other hand, some argue that providing accommodations may be too costly or place an undue burden on universities.

One key argument in favor of providing accommodations to disabled students is that it is required by law. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in all areas of public life, including education. Under the ADA, universities are required to provide reasonable accommodations to allow disabled students equal access to education. Failure to do so can result in legal action against the university.

In addition to being required by law, providing accommodations also helps create a more inclusive and diverse learning environment. By accommodating disabled students' needs, universities send a message that they value diversity and are committed to ensuring all students have an equal opportunity for success. This can help create a more welcoming atmosphere for all students and promote a sense of belonging within the university community.

Accommodations can take many forms, depending on the specific needs of each student. Some common examples include extended time on exams, alternative formats for textbooks or course materials (e.g., audio or Braille), accessible classrooms and facilities (e.g., ramps or elevators), sign language interpreters, note-taking services, and assistive technology devices (e.g., screen readers or voice recognition software). Providing these types of accommodations can help level the playing field for disabled students and enable them to fully participate in their education.

Despite these benefits, some argue that providing accommodations may be too costly for universities or place an undue burden on them. Accommodations such as specialized equipment or assistive technology devices can be expensive, especially if they need regular maintenance or upgrades. In addition, hiring sign language interpreters or note-takers may require additional resources from the university's budget.

While cost is certainly a valid concern when considering whether universities should provide accommodations to disabled students , it should not outweigh the importance of ensuring equal access  .
