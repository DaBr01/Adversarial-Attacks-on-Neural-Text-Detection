Should school students be allowed to curate their high school curriculum? This question has sparked heated debates among educators, parents, and students themselves. Some argue that giving students the freedom to choose their own courses will foster autonomy and passion for learning. Others believe that a structured curriculum is necessary to ensure students receive a well-rounded education. In this essay, I will argue that school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum.

One of the main reasons why students should have a say in their high school curriculum is that it allows them to pursue their interests and passions. Allowing students to choose their own courses empowers them to take ownership of their education and creates a sense of autonomy. When students are able to study subjects they are passionate about, they are more likely to be engaged and motivated to learn. This can lead to better academic performance and a higher level of satisfaction with their education.

Furthermore, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum can help prepare them for the real world. In college and in the workforce, individuals are expected to make decisions and take responsibility for their own learning. By giving students the opportunity to choose their own courses, they learn valuable skills such as time management, decision-making, and goal-setting. These skills will be invaluable as they move on to higher education or enter the workforce.

In addition, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum can help address the issue of student disengagement. Many students become disenchanted with school because they feel that the curriculum is not relevant to their interests or goals. By allowing students to choose their own courses, schools can tailor the curriculum to meet the individual needs and interests of each student. This personalization can help increase student engagement and motivation, leading to improved academic outcomes.

Critics of allowing students to curate their high school curriculum argue that a structured curriculum is necessary to ensure that students receive a well-rounded education. They believe that allowing students to choose their own courses may result in gaps in their knowledge and skills. However, with proper guidance from teachers and counselors, students can still fulfill core requirements while also exploring their interests. Additionally, schools can implement systems to ensure that students are exposed to a variety of subjects and experiences throughout their high school careers.

In conclusion, allowing school students to curate their high school curriculum can have numerous benefits for both students and schools. It can foster autonomy, passion for learning, and real-world skills while addressing issues of disengagement and relevance in the curriculum. With the right support and guidance, students can create a well-rounded education that meets their individual needs and interests. Therefore, schools should consider giving students more agency in shaping their educational experiences.
