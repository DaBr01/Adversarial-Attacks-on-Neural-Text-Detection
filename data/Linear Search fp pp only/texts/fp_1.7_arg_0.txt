The debate over whether school students should have the ability to curate their high school curriculum has been a topic of controversy for many years. While some argue that allowing students to choose their own courses fosters independence and creates a more personalized learning experience, others believe that it can lead to academic gaps in essential subjects and limit opportunities for future success. Ultimately, the decision on whether or not students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum is complex and requires careful consideration of both sides.

Proponents of allowing students to curate their high school curriculum argue that it promotes independence and individualized learning experiences. By giving students the freedom to choose which courses they take, they are able to explore areas of interest, develop critical thinking skills, and take ownership of their education journey. This approach can help foster a passion for learning and improve student engagement in the classroom.

Furthermore, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum can provide them with valuable life skills such as time management, organization, decision-making, and goal setting. These are essential skills that will benefit students beyond high school into college or the workforce.

In addition,the opportunity for elective course selection allows advanced learners an avenue through which they may further challenge themselves academically.Through this process,such individuals stand more chances at maximizing there potential while also engaging other leisure interests.With regards research studies,it is evidenced by psychologists such as Csikszentmihalyi (1997)that people perform best when given autonomy over certain aspect's within there daily tasks,this may potentially translate similarly here.Furthermore,having autonomy would foster personal growth,promote self esteem,and generally increase motivation all crucial factors within positive student development traits important fora successful career trajectory post-secondary education.
