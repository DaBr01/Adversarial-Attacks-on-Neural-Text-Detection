The death penalty, also known as capital punishment, is a highly debated and controversial topic worldwide. While some argue that it serves as a deterrent to crime and provides justice for victims, others believe it is inhumane and violates human rights. The question of whether the death sentence should be implemented globally continues to spark heated debates among policymakers, activists, scholars, and ordinary citizens.

One argument in favor of implementing the death penalty globally is that it serves as a strong deterrent to heinous crimes such as murder or terrorism. Proponents argue that the fear of facing execution may prevent potential criminals from committing violent acts out of fear for their own lives. In countries where capital punishment exists and is enforced rigorously - like Singapore or Saudi Arabia - crime rates are believed by some to be lower compared to nations where this practice has been abolished.

Moreoverm many proponents contend that executing convicted criminals who committed grave offenses represents justice for victims' families seeking closure after losing their loved ones tragically due to such crimes. They argue that sentencing perpetrators responsible for egregious acts condemns such behavior while providing solace knowing these individuals will never harm anyone again.

On the other hand howeverm opponents assert numerous reasons why implementation on global level would not only unjust but also unwise decisionm First off all arguments against capita punishent speak about its moral implications: taking someone's life makes our legal system just like those we try escape imprisonment form It reinforces vengeful attitude ratherthan deterrence-based logical policies
