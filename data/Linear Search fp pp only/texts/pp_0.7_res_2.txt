Terrorism has become a global issue that threatens the safety and security of individuals worldwide. While there are various theories and explanations for why terrorism is on the rise, many experts agree on certain events and experiences that have contributed to this increase. In this essay, I will discuss some of these factors and provide evidence supporting their role in the rise of terrorism.

One of the key events that experts agree have fueled the increase in terrorism is the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. The invasion, which was strongly opposed by many countries and fueled anti-Western sentiment across the Middle East, created a power vacuum and fueled sectarian tensions in the region. The subsequent insurgency led by groups like Al-Qaeda in Iraq eventually gave rise to the Islamic State (IS), a terrorist organization that has carried out numerous attacks around the world.

Another factor that has been identified as a major contributor to the increase in terrorism is the ongoing conflict in Syria. The civil war, which began in 2011, has drawn in various regional and international actors and created fertile ground for extremist groups to thrive. The Syrian conflict has also led to the rise of IS and other terrorist organizations, who have used the chaos and instability to recruit fighters and launch attacks.

The rise of social media and the internet has also played a significant role in the increase in terrorism. Extremist groups have effectively used online platforms to spread their message, recruit followers, and coordinate attacks. The ease of access to information and the ability to connect with like-minded individuals online has allowed terrorist groups to reach a wider audience and radicalize individuals in ways that were not possible in the past.

In addition to these external factors, there are also internal experiences that have contributed to the increase in terrorism. Economic hardship, political oppression, and social marginalization have all been identified as factors that drive individuals to join terrorist groups. The feeling of alienation and disenfranchisement can push individuals towards extremist ideologies and make them more susceptible to radicalization.

Overall, it is clear that a combination of external events and internal experiences are contributing to the increase in terrorism. Addressing these root causes, such as resolving conflicts, tackling social inequalities, and countering extremist narratives, is crucial in combating terrorism and ensuring the safety and security of individuals worldwide.

In conclusion, events such as the US-led invasion of Iraq, the conflict in Syria, the rise of social media, and internal experiences like economic hardship and political oppression are all factors that experts agree have contributed to the increase in terrorism. By understanding and addressing these factors, we can work towards preventing further acts of terrorism and promoting peace and stability in the world.
