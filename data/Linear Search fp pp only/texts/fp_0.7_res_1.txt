Universities are institutions of higher education that strive to provide a learning environment that is inclusive and accessible to all students. In order to achieve this goal, it is essential for universities to provide accommodations to disabled students in order to ensure equal opportunities for success.

One argument in favor of providing accommodations to disabled students is the legal obligation under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The ADA prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in all areas of public life, including education. This means that universities are required by law to provide reasonable accommodations to disabled students in order to ensure they have an equal opportunity to participate in and benefit from educational programs and activities. Failure to do so can result in legal action being taken against the university.

Another argument for providing accommodations is the ethical obligation universities have towards their students. Universities have a moral responsibility to create an environment that is inclusive and welcoming to all individuals, regardless of their abilities. By providing accommodations, universities demonstrate their commitment to diversity and equity, and show that they value the contributions of all members of their community.

Furthermore, providing accommodations can significantly improve the academic performance and overall well-being of disabled students. Accommodations such as extended test-taking time, note-taking services, sign language interpreters, or assistive technology can help level the playing field for disabled students and allow them to fully engage in their education. Research has shown that when provided with appropriate accommodations, disabled students are more likely to succeed academically, gain confidence in their abilities, and develop important skills needed for future success.

In addition, offering accommodations can also benefit non-disabled students by creating a more inclusive learning environment that celebrates diversity and promotes empathy and understanding. When non-disabled students see their peers receiving necessary accommodations, it can help reduce stigma associated with disabilities and foster a culture of inclusivity on campus.

However, there are some challenges associated with providing accommodations to disabled students. Universities may face financial constraints when it comes to funding necessary resources or support services for disabled students. Additionally, there may be logistical challenges in coordinating accommodations across different departments or faculty members within the university.

In conclusion, it is clear that universities should provide accommodations to disabled students in order to fulfill their legal obligations under the ADA, meet their ethical responsibilities towards all members of their community, improve academic outcomes for disabled students, create a more inclusive learning environment for everyone on campus. Though there may be challenges associated with providing these accommodations., it is vital for universities uphold these responsibilities by investing resources into ensuring accessibility for all members of their community - regardless whether or not they require specific supports due​​​ ​​to​​ disability​ .
