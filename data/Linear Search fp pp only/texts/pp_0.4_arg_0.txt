The traditional model of high school education typically involves a set curriculum that all students are required to follow. However, some educators and students argue that allowing students to curate their own high school curriculum would lead to a more personalized and engaging educational experience. While there are valid arguments on both sides of the issue, I believe that students should be allowed to have some input in curating their high school curriculum.

One of the main arguments in favor of allowing students to curate their high school curriculum is that it would increase student engagement and motivation. When students have more control over their own education, they are more likely to be interested in the material being taught. By allowing students to choose courses that align with their interests and career goals, they become more invested in their education and are more likely to succeed academically.

Additionally, giving students the opportunity to curate their high school curriculum allows them to explore subjects that may not be offered in a traditional curriculum. For example, a student who is interested in computer science may choose to take additional programming courses outside of the standard curriculum. This flexibility allows students to pursue their passions and develop skills that will benefit them in the future.

Another argument in favor of allowing students to curate their high school curriculum is that it promotes critical thinking and decision-making skills. By giving students the responsibility to choose their own courses, they learn how to prioritize their goals and make informed decisions about their education. This experience can help them develop important skills that are essential for success in college and beyond.

On the other hand, some critics argue that allowing students to curate their high school curriculum could lead to a lack of foundational knowledge in essential subjects. They argue that students may choose to neglect subjects like math or English in favor of more attractive elective courses. While this is a valid concern, it can be addressed by setting certain requirements for graduation, such as a minimum number of credits in core subjects.

In conclusion, I believe that students should be allowed to have some input in curating their high school curriculum. Allowing students to choose courses that align with their interests and goals can lead to increased engagement, motivation, and critical thinking skills. While there are potential drawbacks to this approach, they can be mitigated by setting certain guidelines and requirements for graduation. Ultimately, giving students more control over their education can lead to a more personalized and fulfilling high school experience.
