Preschool education has been gaining prominence in recent years as researchers and parents acknowledge its benefits for children's academic achievement. Many studies have suggested that children who attend preschool tend to perform better academically compared to those who do not receive early childhood education. This essay will explore the evidence supporting the claim that preschool attendance is linked to improved school success.

One of the key reasons why preschool attendance leads to better outcomes in later schooling is its impact on school readiness. Preschool programs are designed to help children develop essential skills such as language, literacy, numeracy, and social-emotional competencies. Research shows that these foundational skills are critical for academic success in elementary school and beyond. A study by Duncan et al., (2007) found that participation in a high-quality preschool program was associated with significantly higher levels of reading and math proficiency at age 14.

Furthermore, attending preschool can help narrow the achievement gap between disadvantaged students and their more privileged peers. Children from low-income families often lack access to resources and experiences that promote cognitive development before entering formal schooling. By providing an early learning environment with structured activities and experienced educators, preschool programs can mitigate some of these disparities by giving all children an equal footing when they start kindergarten.

Preschool also offers opportunities for young learners to develop crucial social skills such as cooperation, communication, empathy, self-regulation, and problem-solving abilities â€“ all of which play a significant role in academic success later on (Rimm-Kaufman & Pianta , 2000). Studies have shown that students who possess strong socio-emotional competencies tend to have higher grades,

Some critics argue against the notion favoring per-preschool but no major research back this assumptions or highlight neccesites; thus,Critics might cite concerns about overemphasis on academics during early childhood or worry about potential burnout among young students facing increased pressure at an earlier age if this become paradigma shift.Due,no guarantee familes willing make effort based issue without direct scientific prove.
