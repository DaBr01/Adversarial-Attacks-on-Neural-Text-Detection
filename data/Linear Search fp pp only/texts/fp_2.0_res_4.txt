Preschool is a crucial stage in a child's development and can have significant impacts on their academic success later on in life. Studies have shown that children who attend preschool often perform better in school compared to those who do not receive early childhood education.

One of the key reasons why children who attend preschool do better in school is that they are exposed to foundational concepts and skills at an early age. Preschools typically focus on developing basic skills such as counting, letter recognition, and social interaction. By introducing these concepts early on, children are better prepared for kindergarten and beyond.

Furthermore, attending preschool can help improve a child's cognitive abilities. Research has shown that exposure to structured learning environments at a young age can enhance brain development and critical thinking skills. This increased cognitive ability gives children an advantage when transitioning into elementary school settings where more complex tasks are introduced.

Another benefit of attending preschool is the opportunity for children to develop important social-emotional skills. Preschools provide a safe environment for young learners to interact with peers, express emotions, and learn how to navigate social situations effectively. These social-emotional skills are essential for success both academically and socially throughout their educational journey.

In addition to academic benefits, studies have also found long-term positive effects of attending preschool on future educational outcomes. A study conducted by the National Institute for Early Education Research (NIEER) found that students who attended high-quality pre-K programs were more likely to graduate from high school compared  those who did not receive early childhood education..
