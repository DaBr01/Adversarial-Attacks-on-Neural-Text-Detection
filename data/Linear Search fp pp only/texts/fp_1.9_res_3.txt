Technology and gadgets have become an integral part of our daily lives, with many children growing up in a digital world where smartphones, tablets, and computers are commonplace. While technology can offer various benefits to children in terms of education and entertainment, there are also concerns about how these devices may be affecting their studies.

One way in which technology can impact the studies of children is through distractions. With constant access to social media apps, games, and other forms of entertainment on their devices, it can be easy for students to lose focus on their schoolwork. Research has shown that multitasking between studying and using electronic devices can lead to decreased academic performance as well as problems with attention span. This distraction factor is particularly concerning during important study periods such as exam season when students need to concentrate fully on their work.

Moreover, technology use before bedtime has been linked to poor sleep quality which can negatively impact a child's ability to learn effectively the next day at school. The blue light emitted by screens suppresses the production of melatonin – a hormone that regulates sleep – making it harder for kids who use gadgets late into the night fall asleep quickly or get restful sleep.
