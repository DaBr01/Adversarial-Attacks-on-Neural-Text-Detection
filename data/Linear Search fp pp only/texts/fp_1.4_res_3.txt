In today’s digital age, technology and gadgets play a significant role in the lives of children. From smartphones and tablets to laptops and gaming consoles, these devices have become ubiquitous in households around the world. While technology can offer numerous benefits for education and learning, it also has its drawbacks when it comes to impacting children’s studies.

One of the primary ways that technology affects children's studies is through distraction. With easy access to entertainment apps, social media platforms, and online games, children can easily get sidetracked from their schoolwork. According to a study conducted by Common Sense Media, teens spend an average of over seven hours per day on screens for entertainment purposes. This excessive screen time can take away valuable hours that could be spent studying or doing homework.

Furthermore, constant exposure to screens can disrupt sleep patterns which are crucial for academic performance. The blue light emitted from electronic devices suppresses melatonin production which makes it harder for kids to fall asleep at night. Lack of proper rest negatively impacts attention span, memory retention, and cognitive function – all essential elements for successful studying.

Technology also poses challenges when it comes to promoting physical activity among children. Kids who spend prolonged periods sitting in front of screens are less likely to engage in physical exercise which is essential for overall health as well as concentration levels during study time.
