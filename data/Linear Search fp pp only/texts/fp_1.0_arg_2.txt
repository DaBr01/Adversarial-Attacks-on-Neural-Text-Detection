The death sentence, also known as capital punishment, has been a hotly debated topic for centuries. While some argue that it is a necessary form of punishment for heinous crimes, others believe it is inhumane and ineffective. As the global community continues to grapple with the issue of capital punishment, it raises the question: Should the death sentence be implemented globally?

One argument in favor of implementing the death sentence globally is that it serves as a deterrent to potential criminals. Proponents of this view argue that knowing they could be sentenced to death for their actions may prevent individuals from committing serious crimes such as murder or acts of terrorism. They believe that the fear of facing the ultimate punishment will discourage people from engaging in criminal behavior.

Furthermore, supporters of capital punishment argue that it provides closure and justice to victims and their families. In cases where an individual has committed heinous crimes such as murder, rape, or terrorism, some may feel that the only appropriate form of justice is for the perpetrator to face death themselves. This sense of retribution can provide a sense of closure and vindication for those who have been affected by these horrific acts.

On the other hand,, opponents argue that implementing the death sentence globally is inherently flawed and unethical. They point out several key reasons why capital punishment should not be used as a form if way exprisement:

Firstly,, there have been numerous cases where innocent individuals have been wrongly convicted and sentenced to death., Advocates against global implementation note tht since 1973 more than 180 people have been exonerated from Death Row in just
the United States alone, calling into question whether we can ever truly ensure guilt beyond reasonable doubt..

Secondly,, critics contend That executing criminals does not address underlying issues such as poverty,, mental illness , or social inequality That contribute toi criminal behaviour,. Instead,,, proponents suggest investing in reformative measures Suchas educationn , counselling,and rehabilitation programs To Adress The root causes Of Criminality.radher than simply resortingo t taking lives.
