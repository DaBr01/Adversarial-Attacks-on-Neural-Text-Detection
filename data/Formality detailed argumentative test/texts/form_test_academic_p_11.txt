The issue of whether rape victims should have the right to abort their unborn children is a highly contentious and complex one. In this essay, I argue in favor of allowing rape victims to undergo abortions, citing ethical considerations and the traumatic nature of the circumstances surrounding such pregnancies. This argument is framed within the context of women’s reproductive rights and the principle of bodily autonomy.

One of the primary reasons why rape victims should be allowed to abort their unborn children is the psychological trauma that often accompanies such pregnancies. According to a study by Campbell et al. (2016), many rape victims experience profound psychological distress, including symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. Carrying an unwanted pregnancy to term can exacerbate these symptoms and may lead to long-term emotional and psychological consequences for the victim. Allowing rape victims to choose abortion can help mitigate these harms and empower them to regain control over their bodies and their lives.

Furthermore, from an ethical standpoint, forcing a rape victim to carry a pregnancy to term against her will raises serious concerns about autonomy and consent. In cases of rape, the victim has already had her autonomy violated, and denying her the right to make decisions about her own body only serves to compound this violation. As Beauchamp and Childress (2019) argue in their seminal work on biomedical ethics, respect for autonomy is a foundational principle in medical ethics and should be upheld in all circumstances. Therefore, prohibiting rape victims from accessing abortion services not only violates their autonomy but also perpetuates the cycle of harm initiated by the initial act of violence.

Critics of allowing rape victims to abort their unborn children may argue that the fetus has a right to life that must be respected, regardless of the circumstances of its conception. However, this argument fails to account for the rights and well-being of the victim herself. As Thomson (1971) famously argues in her violinist analogy, the right to life does not entail a right to use another person’s body against their will. In cases of rape, the victim did not consent to becoming pregnant and should not be forced to continue the pregnancy against her will.

In conclusion, the decision of whether rape victims should have the right to abort their unborn children is a complex and contentious one that involves considerations of autonomy, ethics, and psychological well-being. I have argued in favor of allowing rape victims to access abortion services, citing the psychological trauma of such pregnancies, ethical concerns about autonomy and consent, and the principle of bodily autonomy. By allowing rape victims to make decisions about their own bodies and lives, we can empower them to heal from the trauma of sexual violence and move forward with their lives in a way that respects their dignity and humanity.
