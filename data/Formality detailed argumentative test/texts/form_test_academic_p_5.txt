The debate over whether politicians are born with the necessary skills and traits to excel in their role or if these abilities can be learned over time has been a topic of interest within the political science community for many years. In order to effectively address this question, it is important to first define what it means to be a successful politician and then examine the various factors that contribute to an individual's aptitude for political leadership.

According to Zaller (1992), successful politicians are those who excel in areas such as public speaking, negotiation, strategic thinking, and the ability to build consensus among a diverse group of stakeholders. These skills are necessary for navigating the complex landscape of modern politics and achieving policy goals that benefit the greater good. In addition to these technical skills, successful politicians also possess intangible qualities such as charisma, empathy, and the ability to inspire others to follow their lead.

Some scholars argue that these qualities are innate and cannot be taught or learned through formal education or training. For example, Sowell (2010) contends that certain individuals are born with a natural talent for leadership and are able to command respect and influence others from a young age. He argues that these individuals possess a combination of genetic predispositions and environmental factors that make them uniquely suited for a career in politics.

On the other hand, proponents of the nurture side of the debate argue that while some individuals may have a natural aptitude for political leadership, the skills and qualities necessary to excel in this role can be cultivated and developed over time. For example, Mintzberg (2009) suggests that politicians can acquire leadership skills through a combination of formal education, on-the-job training, and mentorship from more experienced politicians. He argues that through deliberate practice and reflection, individuals can improve their ability to build relationships, communicate effectively, and make strategic decisions.

In reality, it is likely that both nature and nurture play a role in shaping the abilities of successful politicians. While some individuals may possess a natural talent for leadership, it is through dedicated effort and continuous learning that they are able to reach their full potential. As Moore and Vannoy (2014) explain, successful politicians are those who are able to adapt to changing circumstances, learn from their mistakes, and continually seek out opportunities for growth and development.

In conclusion, the debate over whether politicians are born or made is a nuanced one that requires a holistic understanding of the various factors that contribute to political success. While some individuals may have a natural aptitude for leadership, it is through deliberate practice, education, and mentorship that they are able to reach their full potential. By taking a balanced approach that considers both nature and nurture, we can better understand the complex interplay of factors that shape the abilities of successful politicians.
