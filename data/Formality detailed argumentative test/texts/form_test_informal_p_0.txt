Alright, so picture this: You're in high school, right? You're stuck studying subjects that you have no interest in, and you're probably thinking, "Why am I even learning this stuff?" Well, I'm here to tell you that maybe it's time for a change. Should school students be allowed to curate their high school curriculum? Absolutely!

First off, let's talk about the fact that not every student is the same. Some of us love math and science, while others prefer art and music. So why should we all be forced to take the same classes? It just doesn't make sense. Letting students choose their own courses would allow us to focus on the subjects we actually enjoy and excel in.

I mean, think about it. If you're passionate about history, wouldn't you rather spend your time studying that instead of struggling through chemistry? By giving students the freedom to curate their own curriculum, we can tailor our education to our strengths and interests. This would not only make school more enjoyable but also help us develop our skills in areas that truly matter to us.

Plus, let's not forget that high school is supposed to prepare us for the real world, right? Well, guess what? In the real world, we have choices. We get to decide what career path we want to take and what skills we need to succeed. So why not start practicing that decision-making process in high school? By allowing students to curate their own curriculum, we can learn how to make informed choices about our education and future.

Now, I know what some of you might be thinking. "But won't students just choose the easy classes and avoid challenging themselves?" Sure, that might happen to some extent. But hey, that's life. We all make mistakes and learn from them. And who knows, maybe some of us will surprise ourselves and take on new challenges that we never thought we could handle.

In the end, letting students curate their high school curriculum is all about empowerment. It's about taking control of our education and shaping it to fit our individual needs and goals. So why not give us the chance to make our high school experience more enjoyable, meaningful, and relevant to our future?

I don't know about you, but I'm all for it. Let's break the mold, shake things up, and let students curate their high school curriculum. Who's with me?
