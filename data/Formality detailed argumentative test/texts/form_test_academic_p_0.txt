In recent years, there has been a growing debate on whether school students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum. Proponents of this idea argue that personalized learning can increase student engagement and motivation, leading to better academic outcomes. On the other hand, opponents argue that a standardized curriculum ensures that all students receive a well-rounded education and are prepared for higher education or the workforce. This essay aims to explore both sides of the argument and provide evidence to support the claim that students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum.

One of the main arguments in favor of allowing students to curate their high school curriculum is that personalized learning can lead to increased student engagement. In a study conducted by Johnson et al. (2017), it was found that students who were given more control over their learning experience showed higher levels of motivation and interest in the material. This suggests that when students have a say in what they are learning, they are more likely to be engaged and invested in their education.

Furthermore, allowing students to curate their high school curriculum can help them develop important skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and decision-making. By choosing their own courses and projects, students can tailor their educational experience to their individual interests and goals, preparing them for success in the future. For example, a student who is passionate about science may choose to focus on advanced science courses, while a student interested in the arts may choose to take more creative writing or art classes.

Additionally, personalized learning can help address the diverse needs and learning styles of students. As noted by Darling-Hammond and Viner (2012), students come from a variety of backgrounds and experiences, and a one-size-fits-all approach to education may not be effective for all students. By allowing students to curate their curriculum, educators can better meet the individual needs of students and provide a more inclusive and equitable learning environment.

Opponents of allowing students to curate their high school curriculum argue that a standardized curriculum ensures that all students receive a well-rounded education. They assert that a set curriculum helps establish common educational expectations and ensures that students are adequately prepared for higher education or the workforce. However, research by Hattie et al. (2007) suggests that a standardized curriculum may not be the most effective approach for all students, as it may not align with their individual interests and abilities.

In conclusion, the evidence presented in this essay supports the claim that students should be allowed to curate their high school curriculum. Personalized learning can increase student engagement, help develop important skills, and address the diverse needs of students. While a standardized curriculum may have its merits, the benefits of personalized learning far outweigh the potential drawbacks. As such, educators and policymakers should consider implementing policies that allow students to have a greater say in their educational experience.
