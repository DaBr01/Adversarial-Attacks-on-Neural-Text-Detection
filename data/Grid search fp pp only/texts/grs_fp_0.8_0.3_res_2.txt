In recent years, there has been a noticeable increase in global terrorism, with attacks occurring frequently in various parts of the world. While the motivations behind these acts of terror are complex and multifaceted, there are several key events and experiences that many experts agree are contributing to the rise in terrorism.

One of the factors that is commonly cited as a cause of increased terrorism is political instability and conflict. Countries that are experiencing internal strife or civil war often become breeding grounds for extremist groups, as they take advantage of the chaos to recruit new members and carry out attacks. For example, countries like Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan have all seen a surge in terrorist activity following prolonged periods of conflict.

The spread of extremist ideologies is another significant factor in the increase in terrorism. The rise of groups like ISIS and Al-Qaeda has led to an increase in radicalized individuals who are willing to carry out acts of violence in the name of their beliefs. The propagation of these ideologies through social media and online forums has also made it easier for terrorist groups to recruit followers around the world.

Socioeconomic factors also play a role in driving individuals towards extremism. Poverty, unemployment, and lack of education can create feelings of resentment and alienation among certain populations, making them more susceptible to radicalization. In regions where economic opportunities are limited and social services are lacking, individuals may turn to violent extremism as a means of expressing their frustrations or seeking power.

The impact of foreign interventions is another important consideration when examining what is causing the increase in terrorism. Many experts argue that interventions by Western countries in the Middle East have helped create fertile ground for terrorist groups by destabilizing governments and fueling anti-Western sentiment. For example, the US invasion of Iraq in 2003 has been linked to an increase in insurgent activity and sectarian violence that ultimately paved the way for ISIS to establish its stronghold.

Furthermore, societal alienation and discrimination against certain ethnic or religious groups can push individuals towards radicalization. Marginalized communities may feel isolated from mainstream society or targeted by discriminatory policies, leading some individuals to seek solace within extremist circles where they believe their grievances will be heard.
