The topic of the effects of violent cartoons on children is a highly debated issue among parents, educators, and researchers. While some argue that exposure to violent cartoons can have detrimental effects on children's behavior and development, others believe that these effects are minimal or even non-existent.

Numerous studies have tried to determine the impact of violent cartoons on children. One study conducted by Dr. Dimitri Christakis from the University of Washington found that preschool-aged children who watched just nine minutes of a popular fast-paced cartoon show exhibited reduced attention spans compared to those who watched a slower-paced educational program. The study suggested that exposure to rapid-fire television shows could contribute to attention problems in young children.

Furthermore, research has shown that repeated exposure to violent content in cartoons can desensitize children to real-life violence and make them more aggressive. A meta-analysis conducted by psychologists Craig Anderson and Brad Bushman found a strong correlation between watching violent media and aggressive behavior in both short-term laboratory studies as well as long-term longitudinal studies.

In addition, research has also shown that exposure to violent cartoons can lead to an increase in aggressive thoughts, emotions, and behaviors in children. This is known as the "aggressive script hypothesis," which suggests that viewing violence repeatedly leads individuals (especially children) to develop scripts for aggression which they then imitate in real-world situations.

On the other hand, there are conflicting viewpoints when it comes to the effects of violent cartoons on children. Some researchers argue that while exposure to violence may have short-term effects on behavior (such as increased arousal or aggression), these effects fade over time with no lasting impact on attitudes or values.

Moreover, proponents of allowing children access to violent cartoons argue that such content serves as an outlet for their natural curiosity about aggression and helps them understand the consequences of violence in a controlled environment. They believe that sheltering kids from all forms of violence – including fictional portrayals – may do more harm than good by creating feelings of fear or repression.

Overall, it is clear from existing evidence that there is still much debate surrounding this issue. While some research suggests a link between exposure to violent cartoons and negative outcomes such as increased aggression or reduced attention spans in young viewers; other studies point out limitations within these findings or indicate alternative explanations for observed associations.

In conclusion, while there is evidence suggesting potential harmful effects of exposing young children to violent content through cartoons; further research is needed before definitive conclusions can be drawn about how such media influences child development & behavior long term - particularly taking into account individual differences among kids regarding susceptibility towards various forms & degrees				of stimuli presented						to them through			media channels		         		          .
