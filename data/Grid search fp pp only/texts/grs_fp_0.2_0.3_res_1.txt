In recent years, there has been an increasing awareness and emphasis on inclusivity and accessibility in higher education. One of the key issues that has been brought to light is the need for universities to provide accommodations to disabled students. While some may argue that it is unnecessary or too costly, there are several reasons why universities should make accommodations for disabled students to ensure equal access to education.

First and foremost, providing accommodations to disabled students is a matter of equality and fairness. All students should have the same opportunities to succeed in their academic pursuits, regardless of any physical or mental disabilities they may have. Denying accommodations to disabled students would be discriminatory and could prevent them from achieving their full potential.

Moreover, universities have a legal obligation under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) to provide reasonable accommodations to disabled students. Failure to do so could result in legal consequences and penalties for the institution. By providing accommodations, universities can ensure that they are in compliance with federal laws and regulations regarding disability rights.

Additionally, providing accommodations to disabled students benefits not only the individual student but also the university as a whole. Accommodations can help disabled students overcome barriers to learning and allow them to fully participate in classroom activities and discussions. This can lead to a more diverse and inclusive learning environment that benefits all students.

Furthermore, accommodations for disabled students can improve overall student retention and completion rates. By providing the necessary support and resources, universities can help disabled students succeed academically and graduate on time. This can ultimately boost the university's reputation and ranking as a place that values diversity and inclusivity.

Some critics may argue that providing accommodations to disabled students is too costly and burdensome for universities. However, many accommodations are relatively low-cost and simple to implement, such as providing extra time for exams or making materials available in alternative formats. In fact, failing to provide accommodations could ultimately cost universities more in terms of legal fees and reputational damage.

In conclusion, universities should provide accommodations to disabled students in order to ensure equal access to education, comply with legal obligations, promote inclusivity, and improve student success rates. By making these necessary adjustments, universities can create a more welcoming and supportive environment for all students, regardless of their abilities. Ultimately, providing accommodations is not only the right thing to do but also benefits the entire university community.
