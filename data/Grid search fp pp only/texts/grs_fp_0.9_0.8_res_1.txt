According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), one in four adults in the United States has a disability. With such a significant portion of the population facing physical, cognitive, or other challenges, it is crucial that universities provide accommodations to disabled students.

There are several reasons why universities should provide accommodations to disabled students. Firstly, providing equal access to education for all individuals is a fundamental aspect of promoting diversity and inclusivity on college campuses. By offering accommodations such as accessible classrooms, assistive technology, note-taking services, and extended time on exams, universities can ensure that disabled students have the same opportunities to succeed academically as their non-disabled peers.

Furthermore, denying accommodations to disabled students not only violates federal laws such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) but also perpetuates systemic discrimination against individuals with disabilities. Just as it would be unacceptable to deny accommodations based on race or gender, it is equally unacceptable to deny them based on disability status.

Additionally, providing accommodations to disabled students benefits not only those individuals but also society as a whole. By enabling disabled individuals to pursue higher education and gain valuable skills and knowledge, universities contribute to creating a more inclusive and equitable society where everyone has an opportunity to thrive.

Moreover, research has shown that providing accommodations can have positive outcomes for both disabled students and their non-disabled peers. For example, studies have found that implementing universal design principles in curriculum development can improve learning outcomes for all students by making materials more accessible and engaging.

On the other hand some argue against providing accommodation primarily due financial constraints faced by institutions. They claim that accommodating every student's needs would require significant investments in infrastructure modifications staff training accessibility technology etc; which may not be feasible for many colleges especially small ones with limited resources

However while there may be initial costs associated with providing accommodation ultimately these investments benefit everyone involved As mentioned earlier improving accessibility benefits all students by promoting diverse perspectives engagement While certain changes like building ramps or acquiring assistive technology may be costly in short term they yield long-term benefits terms greater academic achievement higher completion rates enhanced community support systems These positive outcomes far outweigh any upfront expenses incurred

In conclusion universities should provide accommodative measures catered towards enabling educational pursuits differently abled Without these provisions we risk excluding large segment population from achieving their full potential depriving society important contributions Additionally ensuring equal access reflects values fairness justice creates climate fosters respect appreciation differences university campuses should strive embody
