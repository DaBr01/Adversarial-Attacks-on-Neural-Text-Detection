The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) mandates that colleges and universities remove any barriers to education for disabled students. This means that institutions of higher learning must provide reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities. 

One argument for the provision of accommodations is that it ensures equal access to education for all students. By accommodating disabled students, universities are upholding their commitment to diversity and inclusion. Providing accommodations allows disabled students to participate fully in academic activities, such as attending classes, taking exams, and completing assignments. Without these accommodations, disabled students may struggle to keep up with their peers, leading to lower academic performance and potentially hindering their future success.

Furthermore, providing accommodations to disabled students can lead to positive outcomes for all students. When universities support the needs of disabled students, they create a more inclusive environment that benefits the entire student body. This can help foster a sense of empathy and understanding among students, as well as promote a culture of diversity and acceptance on campus.

Another argument in favor of providing accommodations is that it is required by law. The ADA mandates that colleges and universities must provide reasonable accommodations to ensure that disabled students have equal access to education. Failure to do so can result in legal action and penalties for the institution. By complying with the ADA, universities demonstrate their commitment to upholding the rights of all students, regardless of their disabilities.

On the other hand, some may argue that providing accommodations to disabled students is costly and burdensome for universities. Accommodations such as accessible classrooms, technology, and support services may require financial resources and administrative effort. However, it is important to consider that investing in accommodations for disabled students is an investment in student success and retention. By providing the necessary support for disabled students, universities can help them thrive academically and contribute positively to the campus community.

Additionally, some may argue that disabled students should be responsible for securing their own accommodations or seeking assistance from external resources. While it is true that disabled students have a role in advocating for their needs, it is also important for universities to proactively assess and address accessibility issues on campus. By taking a proactive approach to accommodation, universities can create a supportive environment that empowers disabled students to succeed.

In conclusion, universities should provide accommodations to disabled students in order to ensure equal access to education and uphold their legal obligations under the ADA. Providing accommodations not only benefits disabled students but also contributes to a more inclusive and supportive campus community for all students. By investing in accessibility and support services, universities can help disabled students thrive academically and reach their full potential.
