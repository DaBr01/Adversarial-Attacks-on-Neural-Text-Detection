Preschool education has increasingly become a topic of interest and discussion among educators, parents, policymakers, and researchers. Many studies have been conducted to investigate the impact of attending preschool on a child’s academic performance later in life. The question remains: do children who attend preschool do better in school?

Research consistently shows that children who attend preschool are more likely to perform better academically compared to those who do not attend preschool. Several reasons have been proposed for this finding. Firstly, attending preschool provides children with a solid foundation for learning by introducing them to basic academic skills such as letter recognition, counting, and social skills like sharing and cooperation. This early exposure to academics helps children develop important cognitive and social-emotional skills that are essential for success in school.

Furthermore, research suggests that children who attend high-quality preschool programs tend to have higher levels of school readiness compared to their non-preschool counterparts. School readiness refers to a child’s ability to transition smoothly into formal schooling environments and is often assessed based on factors such as language development, math skills, literacy skills, attention span, and social competence. Children who attend preschool are more likely to possess these critical school readiness skills which can give them an academic advantage when they enter kindergarten.

Another key benefit of attending preschool is the positive impact it has on long-term academic outcomes. Numerous studies indicate that children who attend quality preschool programs are more likely to graduate from high school and pursue post-secondary education compared to those who did not attend preschool. Furthermore, research also suggests that the benefits of attending preschool extend beyond academics; individuals who attended quality early childhood education programs are more likely to be employed in adulthood and earn higher incomes.

However, while there is strong evidence supporting the benefits of attending preschool on academic outcomes, it is important to consider certain factors that may influence these findings. For example, the quality of the preschool program plays a significant role in determining its impact on students’ academic success. High-quality programs typically feature well-trained teachers, small class sizes, age-appropriate curriculum materials & activities designed with developmentally appropriate benchmarks/goals (e.g., Social-Emotional Development), safe learning environments conducive for young learners targeting both holistic growth inducing cognitive & physical dev above just rote memorization or isolated individualized studies instead fostering 'collaboration working'.
