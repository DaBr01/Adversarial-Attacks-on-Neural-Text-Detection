Preschool education has become increasingly popular in recent years, with many parents choosing to enroll their children in preschool programs before they enter kindergarten. The question of whether children who attend preschool do better in school is a topic of much debate among educators and researchers. This essay will explore the research on this topic and discuss the potential benefits of attending preschool.

Research studies have shown that children who attend preschool are more likely to do better academically than those who do not. A study conducted by the National Institute for Early Education Research found that students who attended high-quality preschool programs scored higher on standardized tests, had higher graduation rates, and were less likely to repeat grades than those who did not attend preschool. In addition, a study published in the journal Developmental Psychology found that children who attended preschool had stronger literacy and math skills at age five compared to those who did not attend.

One possible reason for these findings is that preschool provides young children with a structured environment where they can learn important social and academic skills. Preschool teachers are trained professionals who know how to engage young learners and help them develop essential skills such as problem-solving, critical thinking, and self-regulation. In addition, attending preschool can help children develop important social-emotional skills such as empathy, cooperation, and impulse control.

Furthermore, research has shown that early childhood education can have long-lasting benefits for children's academic success. A study published in the Journal of Educational Psychology found that students who attended high-quality early childhood education programs were more likely to graduate from high school and attend college than those who did not receive early education. Another study published in the American Journal of Psychiatry found that children who attended Head Start programs were less likely to have behavioral problems or require special education services later in life.

Despite the many benefits of attending preschool, access to high-quality early childhood education remains limited for many families. According to data from the National Center for Education Statistics, only about 43% of three- and four-year-old children are enrolled in some type of preschool program nationwide. This lack of access disproportionately affects low-income families and communities of color, further exacerbating existing educational disparities.

In conclusion, research suggests that attending preschool can provide young children with a strong foundation for future academic success. Children who attend high-quality preschool programs are more likely to score higher on standardized tests, graduate from high school, and attend college than those who do not receive early education. However, access to quality early childhood education remains an issue for many families across the country. Policymakers should prioritize investments in early childhood education to ensure that all children have access to the educational opportunities they need to succeed in school and beyond.
