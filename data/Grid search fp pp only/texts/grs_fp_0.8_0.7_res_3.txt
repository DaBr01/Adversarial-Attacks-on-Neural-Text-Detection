As technology continues to evolve and become more ingrained in our daily lives, it has also significantly impacted the way children learn and study. While there are many benefits to using technology and gadgets for educational purposes, there are also potential drawbacks that can affect a child's academic performance.

One of the most significant ways that technology and gadgets affect children's studies is through their ability to provide access to a wide range of resources and information. With just a few clicks, students can access online libraries, research articles, educational videos, and interactive tutorials that can enhance their learning experience. This allows students to explore topics in greater depth than traditional textbooks would allow and can help them gain a better understanding of complex concepts.

Furthermore, technology has made it easier for teachers to engage with students in new ways. For example, online platforms like Google Classroom or Zoom have allowed educators to create virtual classrooms where they can communicate with students outside of regular school hours. This flexibility allows students to ask questions or seek clarification on assignments at any time, leading to a more individualized learning experience.

Another benefit of using technology in education is its ability to make learning more engaging and interactive. Educational games, simulations, and other digital tools can help capture students' attention by presenting information in a fun and interactive way. These tools can also cater to different learning styles by providing visual aids or audio instructions that may not be available in traditional classroom settings.

However, despite these advantages, there are negative consequences of excessive use of technology and gadgets on children's studies. One major concern is the potential for distractions while studying. With easy access to social media apps, video streaming services, or mobile games on their devices, children may struggle to stay focused on their academic tasks. This can lead to decreased productivity during study sessions or even procrastination if they prioritize entertainment over schoolwork.

In addition, spending too much time on electronic devices can have negative effects on children's physical health as well as mental well-being. Prolonged screen time has been linked to issues such as eye strain, poor posture from hunching over devices for extended periods, disrupted sleep patterns due to exposure to blue light before bed-time among others; all of which may impact a child's ability focus during studies.

Overall we see how technology affects the studies of children both positively with enhanced engagement levels but simultaneously experiences challenges such as distraction from useful digital resources under uncontrolled usage patterns thus it remains crucial that parents & educators set reasonable limits around screen-time usage so as balance healthy engagement levels with academics conducive environment supporting student success overall making educative media an asset when allowed purposeful integration into studying activities rather hindering tool capable detriments under misuse habits alone .
