In recent years, there has been a growing emphasis on ensuring equal access to education for all students, including those with disabilities. As a result, many universities have begun to provide accommodations and support services to help disabled students succeed academically. However, the question of whether universities should be responsible for providing these accommodations is still a topic of debate.

One argument in favor of universities providing accommodations to disabled students is that it aligns with principles of equality and inclusivity. By offering specialized services such as assistive technology, note-taking assistance, extended testing time, or accessible housing options, universities can create an environment where all students have the opportunity to thrive. This not only benefits disabled students but also contributes to a more diverse and inclusive campus community.

Furthermore, offering accommodations can help level the playing field for disabled students who may face additional challenges in their academic pursuits. For example, a student with dyslexia may require extra time on exams or access to audiobooks in order to fully engage with course material. Providing these accommodations can make it possible for these students to demonstrate their abilities and reach their full potential without being hindered by their disability.

Additionally, providing accommodations can also be seen as fulfilling legal obligations under legislation such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). This federal law prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in all areas of public life, including education. Universities that fail to provide reasonable accommodations could find themselves facing legal consequences for violating this law.

On the other hand, some argue that it is not fair or feasible for universities to bear the burden of providing accommodations for disabled students. They point out that accommodating every individual's needs could be costly and resource-intensive for institutions already struggling with budget constraints. In some cases, this could lead universities to divert funds from other important programs or activities in order to meet accommodation requests.

Others argue that disabled students should instead seek support from external organizations or government agencies specializing in disability services rather than relying on universities alone. They believe that requiring institutions of higher education to take on this responsibility places an unfair burden on them when there are other resources available.
