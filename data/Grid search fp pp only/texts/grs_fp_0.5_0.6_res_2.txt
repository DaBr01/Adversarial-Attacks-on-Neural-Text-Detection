Terrorism is a global issue that has been on the rise in recent years. There are various factors that have been identified as contributing to the increase in terrorism, including events and experiences that individuals go through. In this research essay, we will explore some of these events and experiences that are agreed upon by experts as causing the increase in terrorism.

One of the key events that experts believe contribute to the increase in terrorism is political instability and conflict. When countries face political unrest, civil war, or armed conflict, it creates an environment where terrorist groups can thrive. The lack of security and governance allows terrorist organizations to recruit fighters, carry out attacks, and establish their presence with ease. Furthermore, the grievances stemming from political instability can push individuals towards radicalization and extremism as they seek solutions to their problems through violence.

Another event closely linked to the increase in terrorism is social marginalization and discrimination. Disenfranchised communities who feel marginalized or discriminated against based on their religion, ethnicity, race, or socio-economic status are more vulnerable to radicalization. When individuals feel alienated from society and perceive themselves as outsiders or victims of injustice, they are more likely to be attracted to extremist ideologies that promise them a sense of belonging, purpose, and significance through violent means.

Furthermore, experiences of trauma and atrocities can also lead individuals towards engaging in terrorist activities. Victims of acts of violence or oppression may harbor feelings of anger, resentment, and a desire for revenge against those responsible for their suffering. In some cases, survivors of traumatic events may develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) which increases their vulnerability to being recruited by extremist groups who promise them a way to channel their emotions into violent actions.

Moreover, the proliferation of propaganda and online radicalization has significantly contributed to the increase in terrorism. Terrorist groups use social media platforms and online forums to disseminate their ideologies, recruit new members, glorify acts of violence and showcase successful attacks. The ease with which propaganda can reach vulnerable individuals makes it easier for extremist groups to influence them into committing acts of terror either at home or abroad.
