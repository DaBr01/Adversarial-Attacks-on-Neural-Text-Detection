Terrorism is a global issue that has been on the rise in recent years, causing fear and devastation around the world. There are various events and experiences that contribute to the increase in terrorism, and understanding these factors is crucial in finding ways to prevent and combat terrorism effectively.

One of the key factors contributing to the increase in terrorism is political instability and injustices. Many terrorist organizations are motivated by political ideologies and use violence as a means to achieve their goals. In countries where there is political turmoil, corruption, or oppression, individuals may feel marginalized or disenfranchised, leading them to turn to extremism as a way of expressing their grievances and seeking change. The lack of effective governance and rule of law can create an environment where extremist groups thrive, recruit new members, and carry out attacks with impunity.

Another factor that contributes to the increase in terrorism is socioeconomic disparities and poverty. Studies have shown that individuals living in impoverished conditions are more susceptible to radicalization and recruitment by terrorist organizations. Economic hardship can create feelings of hopelessness, anger, and resentment towards those perceived as responsible for their plight. Terrorist groups often exploit these vulnerabilities by offering financial incentives or promises of a better life in exchange for joining their cause.

Furthermore, religious extremism plays a significant role in fueling acts of terrorism around the world. Some extremist groups use religion as a justification for their actions, claiming they are carrying out holy wars or defending their faith from perceived threats. Misinterpretation of religious teachings or manipulation of religious beliefs can lead individuals to commit acts of violence in the name of their faith. This form of extremism has been responsible for numerous terrorist attacks targeting innocent civilians across different religions.

In addition to these factors, social media and online propaganda have played a crucial role in spreading extremist ideologies and recruiting new followers into terrorist organizations. With the rise of social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, ISIS has utilized these platforms effectively to disseminate propaganda videos glorifying acts of violence and promoting their twisted version of Islam. Online recruitment efforts have made it easier for terrorist groups to reach a global audience quickly without detection by authorities.
