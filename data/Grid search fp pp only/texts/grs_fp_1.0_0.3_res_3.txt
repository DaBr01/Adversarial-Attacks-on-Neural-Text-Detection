In today's digital age, children are increasingly exposed to technology and gadgets at a young age. While these tools can offer numerous benefits in terms of learning and development, they also raise concerns about their potential negative impact on children's studies.

One of the main ways technology and gadgets affect the studies of children is through distraction. With access to smartphones, tablets, laptops, and other devices that offer endless entertainment options, many children struggle to focus on their schoolwork. The constant notifications and alerts from social media apps, games, and messaging platforms make it difficult for them to concentrate on their studies. As a result, many children find themselves spending more time on their gadgets than doing homework or studying.

Moreover, the use of technology before bedtime can disrupt sleep patterns and affect academic performance. The blue light emitted by screens can interfere with the production of melatonin, a hormone that regulates sleep-wake cycles. Studies have shown that exposure to screens before bedtime can lead to decreased quality of sleep and impaired cognitive function the next day. This lack of quality sleep can have a detrimental effect on children's ability to focus in school and retain information.

Additionally, excessive screen time has been linked to poor academic performance. Research has found that spending too much time on gadgets is associated with lower grades and standardized test scores among students. The constant multitasking between different apps or websites can prevent children from fully engaging with their study materials or completing assignments efficiently.

Many schools now incorporate online components into their curriculum through platforms like Google Classroom or Khan Academy(2). While these tools offer opportunities for personalized learning experiences(1) , they also require students to navigate complex digital environments filled with distractions.
