There is an ongoing debate on whether universities should provide accommodations to disabled students. While some argue that it is the responsibility of institutions of higher education to create an inclusive environment for all individuals, others believe that providing accommodations gives disabled students an unfair advantage.

One of the main arguments in favor of universities providing accommodations to disabled students is that it helps level the playing field and ensures equal access to education. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) mandates that educational institutions must provide reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities. This includes modifications such as extended test-taking time, accessible classrooms, note-takers, and alternative formats for materials. By providing these accommodations, universities help create a more inclusive learning environment where all students have the opportunity to succeed.

Moreover, accommodating disabled students aligns with universities' mission statements of promoting diversity and inclusivity. By supporting individuals with disabilities, institutions demonstrate their commitment to ensuring that every student has the opportunity to reach their full potential regardless of their physical or mental abilities. Additionally, creating accessible facilities not only benefits current students but also attracts prospective ones who may have disabilities themselves or are looking for a university that values inclusivity.

Another argument in support of providing accommodations is that it can lead to better academic outcomes among disabled students. Research has shown that when given appropriate supports and resources, individuals with disabilities can perform just as well as their non-disabled peers. Providing accommodations such as assistive technology or adaptive equipment can remove barriers and allow disabled students to fully engage in coursework and activities.

On the other hand, opponents argue that providing accommodations gives disabled students an unfair advantage over non-disabled ones. They believe that by receiving additional support services such as extra time on exams or assignments, disabled students are granted privileges not available to other classmates which undermines the principles of fairness and meritocracy within academia.

However, this argument fails to acknowledge the challenges faced by individuals with disabilities who may require extra assistance due to their unique circumstances. Accommodations are meant specifically for leveling the playing field by addressing limitations imposed by disabilities rather than giving preferential treatment.
