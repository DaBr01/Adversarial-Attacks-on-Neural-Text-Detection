According to the World Health Organization, approximately 15% of the world's population live with some form of disability. With higher education becoming increasingly important in today's society, it is essential that universities provide accommodations to disabled students to ensure they have equal access to education.

One argument in favor of universities providing accommodations to disabled students is that it falls under the principles of equality and non-discrimination. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which has been signed by many countries including the United States, emphasizes the right of all persons with disabilities to education without discrimination. By not providing accommodations, universities are in violation of these international agreements.

Moreover, failing to provide accommodations can create significant barriers for disabled students in accessing education. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, students with disabilities are more likely to drop out of college than their non-disabled peers. This dropout rate can be attributed to a lack of support and accommodations available to them. Providing accommodations such as assistive technology, accessible campus facilities, note-taking services, extended test-taking time, and sign language interpreters can help address these barriers and increase retention rates among disabled students.

Furthermore, accommodating disabled students benefits not only the individual student but also the university as a whole. Research has shown that diversity and inclusion in an educational setting enhance learning outcomes for all students. By providing accommodations to disabled students, universities can create a more inclusive learning environment where all students feel valued and supported. In turn, this can lead to improved academic performance, increased graduation rates, and a stronger sense of community on campus.

Opponents of providing accommodations to disabled students may argue that it is costly and burdensome for universities to implement these accommodations. While it is true that providing accommodations can come with a financial cost, it is crucial to consider the long-term benefits of investing in inclusive education. The cost of not providing accommodations, such as lost tuition revenue from dropouts or potential lawsuits for violating anti-discrimination laws, far outweighs the initial investment in accommodations.

In conclusion, universities should provide accommodations to disabled students to uphold principles of equality and non-discrimination, remove barriers to education, and create a more inclusive learning environment. While there may be challenges in implementing accommodations, the benefits of doing so far outweigh the costs. By embracing diversity and supporting all students, universities can better fulfill their mission of providing quality education for all.
