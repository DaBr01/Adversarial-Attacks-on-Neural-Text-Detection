In today's digital age, technology and gadgets have become an integral part of children's lives. From smartphones and tablets to laptops and gaming consoles, children are constantly surrounded by screens and devices that offer a plethora of information and entertainment at their fingertips. While technology has revolutionized the way children learn, communicate, and play, there is growing concern about its impact on their studies.

One of the most significant ways in which technology affects the studies of children is through distractions. With access to social media, video streaming platforms, online games, and countless other apps, children are often tempted to spend more time on their devices than on homework or studying. This constant source of distraction can lead to decreased focus, poor time management skills, and ultimately lower academic performance.

Moreover, excessive screen time can also have negative effects on children's physical health. Prolonged use of electronic devices can result in eye strain, headaches, sleep disturbances, obesity due to lack of physical activity and poor posture leading to musculoskeletal issues. These health problems can not only impact a child's overall well-being but also hinder their ability to concentrate and retain information during study sessions.

Furthermore, technology has changed the way children absorb information. With access to search engines like Google or educational websites such as Khan Academy or Coursera at their fingertips ,children rely heavily on these tools for quick answers instead of engaging in critical thinking or problem-solving skills . As a result ,they may struggle with comprehension retention ,critical analysis – all essential skills for academic success Additionally , reliance solely on digital resources for learning may hinder development effective communication interpersonal skills
