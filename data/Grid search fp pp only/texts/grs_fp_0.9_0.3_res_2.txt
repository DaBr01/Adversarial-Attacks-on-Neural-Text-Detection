Events and experiences that are causing the increase in terrorism can be difficult to pinpoint, as there are numerous factors that contribute to the rise in terrorist activities around the world. However, there are some key events and experiences that many experts agree have played a significant role in fueling the growth of terrorism.

One major factor contributing to the increase in terrorism is the ongoing conflicts and unrest in various regions of the world. The Middle East, for example, has been a hotbed of violence and instability for decades, with ongoing conflicts in countries like Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Yemen providing fertile ground for terrorist organizations to thrive. These conflicts have created power vacuums and fueled anti-government sentiments among populations who feel marginalized or oppressed by their leaders.

Another event that has contributed to an increase in terrorism is globalization and its impact on culture and society. Globalization has connected people from different parts of the world like never before, but it has also brought about cultural clashes and heightened tensions between different groups. Rapid economic development and technological advancements have led to increased migration flows across borders, resulting in greater cultural diversity but also creating social divisions based on ethnicity or religion.

Additionally, social media platforms have had a significant impact on spreading extremist ideologies and recruiting potential terrorists. Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Telegram provide easy access to propaganda videos promoting violence against perceived enemies or encouraging individuals to join extremist groups. These platforms have been used by terrorist organizations like ISIS to recruit followers from around the world who may feel isolated or disenfranchised from mainstream society.

Furthermore, political instability within certain countries has also contributed to the rise of terrorism. Weak governance structures or corrupt governments can create breeding grounds for terrorist groups seeking power or control over vulnerable populations. In some cases, government crackdowns on dissenting voices or minority groups can lead individuals toward more radicalized ideologies as they seek alternative outlets for expressing their grievances.

Lastly, socioeconomic factors such as poverty, unemployment, lack of education opportunities can also drive individuals toward extremism as they seek meaning or purpose in their lives. Terrorist organizations often exploit these vulnerabilities by offering financial incentives or promises of glory through martyrdom which can appeal particularly young people who may lack direction or prospects for a better future.

In conclusion,the increase in terrorism cannot be attributed solely one event our experience; rather it is a complex interplay of various factors including ongoing conflicts,injustice,social polarisation,digital radicalization,and economic marginalization combined together.These issues must be addressed at both national international level if we hope ti stem this growing tide off-terrorism before it gets worse
