Terrorism is a global issue that has been on the rise in recent years. There are various events and experiences that have been identified as factors contributing to the increase in terrorism. In this essay, I will discuss some of these events and experiences that I agree are causing this rise.

One significant event that has led to the increase in terrorism is the ongoing conflicts and instability in various regions around the world. Conflict-ridden regions provide fertile ground for terrorist organizations to thrive and recruit new members. The lack of security and governance in these areas allow terrorist groups to operate with impunity, carrying out attacks on civilians and infrastructure. For example, the ongoing conflict in Syria has created a power vacuum that extremist groups such as ISIS have exploited to establish their caliphate.

Another factor contributing to the increase in terrorism is social marginalization and discrimination faced by certain communities. Many individuals who become terrorists often feel marginalized or discriminated against by society, leading them to seek belonging and purpose through radical ideologies. For example, studies have shown that individuals who join terrorist organizations such as Al-Qaeda or ISIS often come from marginalized communities where they feel alienated from mainstream society.

Furthermore, advancements in technology have also played a role in fostering terrorism. The internet has emerged as a powerful tool for terrorist organizations to spread their propaganda, recruit new members, and plan attacks. Social media platforms provide an avenue for extremists to communicate with like-minded individuals across borders, allowing them to form networks of support and coordination.

Moreover, geopolitical factors such as foreign interventions and military occupations have also contributed to the increase in terrorism. Foreign interventions can lead to resentment among local populations, fueling anti-Western sentiments that can be exploited by terrorist organizations for recruitment purposes. For example, the US invasion of Iraq in 2003 not only destabilized the region but also provided fertile ground for groups like ISIS to gain traction.

In conclusion, there are numerous events and experiences that contribute to the increase in terrorism around the world. Ongoing conflicts, social marginalization, technological advancements, and geopolitical factors all play a role in fostering extremism and radicalization among individuals. Addressing these root causes is crucial in combating terrorism effectively on a global scale. Efforts must be made to promote peace-building initiatives, address societal grievances, regulate online platforms used for recruitment purposes,and reconsider foreign policies that may inadvertently fuel extremism.
