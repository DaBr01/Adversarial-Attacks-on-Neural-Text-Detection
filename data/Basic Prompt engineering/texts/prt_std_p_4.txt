Research shows that attending preschool can have a significant impact on a child's performance in school. Early childhood education experts agree that preschool can provide essential skills and opportunities that set the foundation for future success in school and beyond. 

One of the main benefits of attending preschool is the introduction of structured learning early on in a child's life. Preschools provide a structured environment in which children learn to follow routines, work independently, and interact with peers. These skills are crucial for success in kindergarten and beyond. A study conducted by the National Institute for Early Education Research found that children who attended preschool had higher scores on measures of language, literacy, and math skills compared to those who did not attend preschool. This suggests that the structured learning environment of preschool helps children develop the foundational skills necessary for academic success.

Furthermore, attending preschool has been shown to have long-term benefits for children's academic achievement. A study published in the journal Child Development found that children who attended preschool were more likely to graduate from high school, attend college, and have higher earnings as adults compared to those who did not attend preschool. This suggests that the skills and social interactions gained in preschool have a lasting impact on children's academic and professional success.

Another benefit of attending preschool is the opportunity for children to develop social and emotional skills. Preschool provides a safe and nurturing environment in which children learn to navigate relationships with peers and adults, manage their emotions, and solve problems. These social and emotional skills are essential for success in school and in life. A study published in the journal Developmental Psychology found that children who attended preschool had better social skills, such as sharing, cooperating, and taking turns, compared to those who did not attend preschool. This suggests that preschool plays a crucial role in helping children develop the social and emotional skills necessary for positive relationships and success in school.

In addition to academic and social benefits, attending preschool can also help children develop important cognitive skills. Preschools provide opportunities for children to engage in hands-on learning experiences that promote critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills. A study published in the journal Early Childhood Research Quarterly found that children who attended preschool had higher levels of cognitive skills, such as memory, attention, and reasoning, compared to those who did not attend preschool. This suggests that preschool can help children develop the cognitive skills necessary for academic success.

In conclusion, research suggests that children who attend preschool do better in school. Preschool provides a structured learning environment, social and emotional skills development, and opportunities for cognitive skill development that set the foundation for future academic success. Investing in early childhood education through preschool can have long-term benefits for children's academic achievement and overall well-being.
